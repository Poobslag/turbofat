Turbo Fat is a block-dropping puzzle game for Windows, Linux, iOS, Android and HTML5.

**Turbo Fat is free; you can download the latest version on the [releases page](https://github.com/Poobslag/turbofat/releases), or play it online at [itch.io](https://poobslag.itch.io/turbo-fat).**

The game is inspired by a few other block-dropping games but breaks some rules. Instead of being rewarded for clean horizontal stacks, multiline clears and T-spins, you're rewarded for messy vertical stacks, 3x3 boxes and 'squish moves' where you smush pieces into impossible positions.

The game also includes a story mode where you can interact with other monsters. This will eventually grow to include many characters to meet with unique stories, worlds to explore, and crazy puzzle challenges.

## Summary

Rotate the falling pieces and arrange them into lines to clear them. To earn more money, arrange your pieces into 3x3, 3x4 and 3x5 boxes. The more of these boxes you make, the more money you'll get.

Another way to earn more money is to clear a lot of lines one after the other, which builds a combo. Making boxes also keeps your combo going.

Pressing and holding the 'soft drop' key lets you move pieces past each other. This can help to recover from a poorly placed piece, but also helps when trying to make boxes.

## Controls

  * <kbd>Left</kbd> or <kbd>Right</kbd> moves your piece.
  * <kbd>Z</kbd> or <kbd>X</kbd> rotates your piece.
  * <kbd>Down</kbd> lowers your piece.
  * <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>Up</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> drops your piece immediately.
  * <kbd>Esc</kbd> brings up a menu.
