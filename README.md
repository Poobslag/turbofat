*Turbo Fat* is a block-dropping puzzle game for Windows, Linux, Android and HTML5.

Turbo Fat was inspired by block-stacking games of the 90s, but builds on them with new pieces, new moves, new ways to score, and hilarious level gimmicks! Misdrop a piece? Use a squish move to fix it! Want higher scores? Build up a combo of 10 lines, 20 lines, 100 lines... there is no limit! Waiting for that crucial line piece? Don't wait long, we got rid of those! (Hey, nobody said it would be easy...)

The game also includes an adventure mode where you can interact with other monsters. This will eventually grow to include many characters to meet with unique stories, worlds to explore, and crazy puzzle challenges.

**Turbo Fat is free; you can download the latest version on the [releases page](https://github.com/Poobslag/turbofat/releases), or play it online at [itch.io](https://poobslag.itch.io/turbo-fat).**
