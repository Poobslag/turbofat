tr("...I mean, I guess I'll walk all the way back there... That's a pretty long walk on an empty stomach...")
tr("Okay fine")
tr("Okay fine")
tr("Okay fine")
tr("Okay fine")

tr("I want the last five minutes of my life back...")
tr("Wow. That is one fat squirrel!")
tr("Excuse me? That's very rude.")
tr("Oh -- I didn't see your friend, sorry. Those are umm, two fat squirrels.")
tr("Thank you.")
tr("And hmm... why are those sticks stuck in the ground?")
tr("Is this a fence post?")
tr("Is this a lawn dart?")
tr("Is this a grave?")
tr("Is this a pigeon?")
tr("Oh, you were mourning your little squirrel friend! That's so sad...")
tr("Oh, you were playing lawn darts! And the cup is to keep score.")
tr("Oh no, someone stole the rest of your fence!")
tr("This one fence post is all that's left. And they left the cup... as a ransom note!")
tr("Oh, it's a giant pigeon! It's buried upside-down, but these two pointy parts are its legs.")
tr("The cup is its umm... tail, and you three are playing a game! Am I close?")
tr("What? No no, nothing like that.")
tr("Someone comes by and leaves food out for us squirrels once a day!")
tr("...But we snuck over early so we could have it to ourselves. Chitter chitter!")
tr("Oh! Hmm... Is this person short and purple? Goes by Turbo?")
tr("Oh! Hmm... Is this person short and purple? Goes by Fat Sensei?")
tr("Maaaaaaybe! ...We'll tell you everything we know, if you feed us.")
tr("Really? You're still hungry!?")
tr("You've got a lot to learn about squirrels...")
tr("Oof, it seems I overate again.")
tr("I'm not going to throw you into your tree, so please don't ask.")
tr("No no, that's alright. I've engineered a system of ropes and pulleys, I can just pull myself up.")
tr("You installed an entire pulley system... just to avoid climbing home after you overeat!?")
tr("That doesn't even make sense. How can someone that lazy also be this motivated?")
tr("...Ah. You've never met an engineer before, have you...")
tr("...")
tr("You again!?")
tr("Sorry! Just a quiiiiiick bite.")
tr("What happened to that German restaurant? I thought they had a nice breakfast.")
tr("I like their food, but this morning they had a line out the door!")
tr("Ohhh I see. ... ...So you're saying, they're too 'kraut-ed'?")
tr("...")
tr("...Nevermind. I've suddenly lost my appetite.")
tr("Get back here!!!")
tr("Oh it's that gravesite again. But there are no squirrels here...")
tr("Hmm, this cup has an inscription! I didn't notice this before. 'We won't forget -- Turbo Fat'.")
tr("Chitter chitter. Aww, we're too early! There's no food yet...")
tr("We'll come back in a little while.")
tr("Oh that's okay! I can make you something quick.")
tr("Hooray!")
tr("So what should we call our new restaurant?")
tr("Hmm yes. Yes yes well, a name is important. It should reflect our identity and set us apart from our competitors.")
tr("I was thinking something like...")
tr("Something like... Junjorito?")
tr("Junjorito")
tr("What on earth is a junjorito?")
tr("I didn't say we had to call it Junjorito! Just something LIKE Junjorito.")
tr("Something like... Caboodles?")
tr("Caboodles")
tr("What on earth is a caboodle?")
tr("You know, like kitten caboodles! Or is it kit 'n caboodles? I don't know... It's just a cute nonsense word!")
tr("Something like... Eaties?")
tr("Eaties")
tr("What on earth is an eatie?")
tr("You know, sort of like foodies... But a friendlier version of it!")
tr("Something like... The Fats of Life?")
tr("The Fats of Life")
tr("Really? You want our restaurant's name to pay homage to a sitcom from what... the 20th century?")
tr("Yeah! It's sort of plays off of your name you know? Because you're Fat Sensei! The Fats of Life!")
tr("Something like... Sparky's?")
tr("Sparky's")
tr("What on earth is a sparky?")
tr("Yeah it's like, a cute little punchy name. Sparky's! Doesn't it sound fun?")
tr("Something like... Smack Dab?")
tr("Smack Dab")
tr("What on earth is a smack dab?")
tr("Oh like that phrase, smack dab in the middle! We'll be smack dab!")
tr("Hmm hmm, yes. Yes, I see your point, we should give our restaurant a really stupid name.")
tr("There aren't a lot of restaurants with stupid names. A name like that could carve out a niche with stupid customers.")
tr("No, not a STUPID name, just something distinctive...")
tr("No, no -- you had it right the first time! Stupid name it is.")
tr("I'll let you come up with it, it seems you have a talent for this.")
tr("Th... thank you? I think...")
tr("Well, you were right. You are a terrible chef.")
tr("Thank you.")
tr("However, your butt speech really spoke to me. Maybe I've been sitting on my butt too much lately, too.")
tr("Well, it would be a shame for someone like you to sit on a butt!")
tr("I suppose it wouldn't be the worst idea to open a restaurant together.")
tr("I could help you with your cooking, and you could help me to not sit on butts.")
tr("That's a great idea")
tr("That's a terrible idea")
tr("I'm not sure")
tr("Oh! Oh wow! That would be great.")
tr("But wait -- isn't opening a restaurant risky? I've heard 90 percent of restaurants fail in their first year...")
tr("I don't think that's a very good idea. I've heard 90 percent of restaurants fail in their first year...")
tr("Hmm maybe? I don't know the first thing about opening a restaurant.")
tr("Like... Isn't it really risky? I've heard 90 percent of restaurants fail in their first year...")
tr("Ahha ha ha! Yes, well. With our concentrated effort and a little luck, maybe we can bring that up to 91 percent.")
tr("Yeah! ...Hey wait...")
tr("(knock knock)")
tr("(knock knock knock knock)")
tr("Do you mind? That's very annoying.")
tr("Sorry! I'm sorry I knocked so many times, but you didn't answer. You're Turbo?")
tr("Mmm yes, of course. I'm Turbo. And your name is...?")
tr("My name is #player#! This may sound weird, but I had a dream about you.")
tr("...I think you're supposed to teach me how to be a great chef!")
tr("Yes yes, I see. My name is Turbo and your name is #player#. That's nice. Goodbye.")
tr("(slam!)")
tr("(knock knock)")
tr("Sorry, I don't have the energy for this today.")
tr("Turbo, you were much nicer in my dream.")
tr("First of all, you should address me as Fat Sensei.")
tr("Second, I was only nice in your dream because we hadn't met before.")
tr("I'll be meaner now that I know how annoying you are.")
tr("(slam!)")
tr("Fat Sensei, I need your help! Being a chef is my dream but I'm terrible at it.")
tr("My roommate's the only one who will eat my cooking, but I think they're only doing it to be nice.")
tr("Everyone else says I should let my hobby be my hobby.")
tr("Even my close friends are pushing me into office jobs, saying I should cook in my free time.")
tr("My parents won't pay for culinary school because they say I won't make a career from it.")
tr("But cooking's the only thing I've ever been passionate about.")
tr("If I can't pursue my dream of cooking I think I just won't pursue any dreams at all.")

tr("The man was...")
tr("The woman was...")

tr("Slow down, nosy!")

tr("Well gosh hurry along then! I wouldn't want to get in between you and the man slash woman of your dreams!")
tr("What! Don't say it like that...")
tr("Don't get lost in the forest! Have fun on your timber date.")
tr("...Ugh. ...Come to think of it, you can make your own lunch.")
tr("Wow Tunathy, you brought a sketchbook to the table? I'd be worried about getting food on it...")
tr("Oh this isn't my good sketchbook. I just draw in it for practice...")
tr("Anyway, it's okay. ...You don't need to feign interest in my personal life. I'm really just here to eat...")
tr("Are these your drawings?")
tr("They're pretty good")
tr("They're so messy")
tr("Wow! They're amazing")
tr("It's like those gorillas")
tr("Wow, these look amazing!!")
tr("What? ...Really?")
tr("I had no idea you were this talented! Do you have anything else I can look at?")
tr("I... I don't know how to react to positive attention, can you say something mean?")
tr("I wish I could draw like that...")
tr("Ack! ...Can't ...breathe!")
tr("They're pretty good! I especially like that one.")
tr("What? ...Really?")
tr("I mean it's obvious these are just for practice, but the underlying technique is there. You have such a cool style!")
tr("I... I don't know how to react to positive attention, can you say something mean?")
tr("I wish I could draw like that...")
tr("Ack! ...Can't ...breathe!")
tr("Ohhhh okay, so it's just like... a bunch of messy sketches! Do you have any actual drawings in here?")
tr("Oh! ...Yeah, I'm sorry. This one's just for me. There's nothing finished.")
tr("It's just I've seen sketchbooks from like... REAL artists where it's these elaborately detailed pages...")
tr("Y-yeahhhh, I know. ...This is just something I sketch in for practice.")
tr("I'm kind of surprised you showed this to me! These just look like something you'd throw away. ...No offense!")
tr("Right, no! Um... None taken...")
tr("Oh wow, this reminds me of -- not to change the subject! But I read about this zoo where they had a donation of paintbrushes,")
tr("And they put them in the primate enclosure and let the gorillas paint. Did you ever hear about that?")
tr("Oh, hmmmmm! ...Yeah I think that rings a bell.")
tr("I mean their paintings were just complete and utter garbage, obviously! Because they're just gorillas.")
tr("Well yeah, that makes sense.")
tr("They don't have the same kind of dexterity or spatial awareness that we take for granted.")
tr("Well anyway... I don't know why that came to mind all of a sudden! Thanks for showing me your sketchbook.")
tr("Ohhhh...")
tr("Oh it's you, Mara! Don't worry, this one will be on the house~")
tr("No that's alright, I don't mind paying! I just love that you're hitting it off so well with Fat Sensei.")
tr("So... When are you going to introduce me to your boyfriend?")
tr("So... When are you going to introduce me to your girlfriend?")
tr("So... When are you going to introduce me to your boyfriend and/or girlfriend?")
tr("What!? We're not dating...")
tr("Oh it's fine, I can introduce myself. Hello, I'm Fat Sensei, #player.possessive# partner.")
tr("My BUSINESS partner.")
tr("...Uhh but anyways Fat Sensei, this is my roommate Mara! Well, I don't know if we're technically roommates?")
tr("I cook for them sometimes, and in exchange they let me sleep in their guest room for free.")
tr("Wait. ...Are you serious!?!")
tr("Mara, I mean this in the nicest way possible. I've tasted #player.possessive# cooking. ...They should be paying rent.")
tr("Oh? ...Th-thank you!")
tr("WHAT?! Don't thank them for that!")
tr("I'm sorry! You have a very nice boyfriend. ...Sorry! I mean, 'Partner'.")
tr("I'm sorry! You have a very nice girlfriend. ...Sorry! I mean, 'Partner'.")
tr("I'm sorry! You have a very nice boyfriend and/or girlfriend. ...Sorry! I mean, 'Partner'.")
tr("... (grumble) ...")
tr("So each table should have their food done all at once. Which means when you're cooking it, you should-")
tr("You don't gotta train me, I've got plenty of experience with this sorta thing.")
tr("Oh, like... restaurant experience?")
tr("Nah nah, failed business experience.")
tr("Failed business experience!?")
tr("But we just started!")
tr("You've never worked in a kitchen?")
tr("...Wait, can you cook?")
tr("We're not failing!")
tr("We just got started! We're not failing...")
tr("Oh sure sure! I'm sure your first million is just around the corner. Take my advice though-")
tr("You've never worked in a kitchen?")
tr("What, you think a kitchen's any different than working a call center or mortuary? Take my advice-")
tr("Wait... do you know how to cook?")
tr("I'm not the best, but I'll pick up what I need to. It's not the cooking that's the important part! Take my advice-")
tr("Pshh! Our business isn't failing!")
tr("Oh sure sure! I'm sure your first million is just around the corner. Take my advice though-")
tr("The secret is to half-ass your job, take on JUST enough responsibility to look busy while staying out of trouble.")
tr("That way when things start to go south, you look like a team player and not a liability! It's a delicate balance.")
tr("At least let me teach you the BASICS of cooking...")
tr("Pshh look at you, you little try-hard! You're not gonna last three weeks at a place like this...")
tr("Hey Tunathy! ...So how's your art doing?")
tr("Ohh well... I'm still struggling to find customers.")
tr("But on the bright side, having no work to do gives me plenty of free time to succumb to my irrepressible ennui...")
tr("Marketing yourself is tough")
tr("Enjoy the free time")
tr("All art is subjective, but...")
tr("Well, marketing yourself is tough. I hate doing that kind of stuff, it almost feels arrogant you know?")
tr("One trick some people use is to pretend they're talking about someone else, instead of talking about themselves!")
tr("But even then, it just takes practice really.")
tr("Free time's kind of a blessing in itself! It gives you more time to practice and hone your skills.")
tr("In a few years when you're bombarded with customers, I'm sure you'll wish you had this kind of opportunity again.")
tr("Well... All art is subjective.")
tr("...If people don't like your art, then that means your art is subjectively bad! I wouldn't take it too personally.")
tr("I don't... ...Why are you paying attention to me? Is it because you want me to tip more?")
tr("What's this? I only heard half of the conversation. But yes, we want you to give us more money.")
tr("No we don't! Tunathy, I'm just trying to...")
tr("Cheer you up")
tr("Help you out")
tr("Be your friend")
tr("I'm just trying to be your friend!")
tr("Wait... so you're expressing a genuine interest in my personal life? I'm so confused...")
tr("I'm just trying to help you out.")
tr("Wait... you're expressing a genuine interest in my well-being? I'm so confused...")
tr("I'm just trying to cheer you up!")
tr("Wait... you're expressing a genuine interest in my well-being? I'm so confused...")
tr("Sorry. ...What #player# is trying to explain is, hmm....")
tr("Friends, TRUE friends. True friends give each other money all the time! They don't even think about it.")
tr("You should give us more money, and maybe we'll like you more.")
tr("Well... Sure, that seems fair, let's see how much I got...")
tr("That's not right at all!!! Get out of here.")
tr("(sigh) Don't listen to Fat Sensei! They don't know what they're talking about. Anyways where were we...")
tr("Is five dollars okay?")
tr("...")
tr("So how are you two related? Are you siblings, or...")
tr("Oh, no! We're not related.")
tr("Really? Because the resemblance is uncanny.")
tr("No no. No relation, we're just partners.")
tr("BUSINESS partners.")
tr("Well, that seems redundant...")
tr("It ISN'T.")
tr("Hmm, so long have you been together?")
tr("Been together IN BUSINESS.")
tr("...")
tr("Umm well anyway, I'm going to take off! Good luck with your... ...business.")
tr("Our BUSINESS business.")
tr("Wait -- nope. That one was okay.")
tr("Ahhh Sidger, we had a complaint at table three. Apparently the fudge drops were overdone.")
tr("Nuh-uh, that wasn't me. That was #player.possessive# fault.")
tr("What? No it wasn't!")
tr("Hmm, I see. #player#, try to focus more. These careless mistakes of yours are making you a real liability.")
tr("Sidger, you're so conniving!")
tr("Sensei, you're so gullible!")
tr("This has nothing to do with me")
tr("Look who's at the stove!")
tr("Sidger, you conniving little... munch!")
tr("If you're gonna lie, at least lie about something that matters! Not just, overcooking this one stupid-")
tr("Sensei, how are you this gullible!?")
tr("Sidger's cooked everything today, I've just been coaching them. How would it even make sense for me to-")
tr("This has nothing to do with me, I haven't cooked a single thing today. I've just been watching Sidger-")
tr("Look who's at the stove, they didn't even move an inch! how could you possibly think that I-")
tr("Now now, you shouldn't go around blaming each other. #player#, you need to be more of a team player like Sidger.")
tr("...Remember what I was saying about a delicate balance?")
tr("@#$%!")
tr("...Teach me...")
tr("I'll focus on my cooking")
tr("...Teach me...")
tr("Heh heh heh. Sorry, you're good as done for.")
tr("Why don't you go delicately balance yourself on top of some train tracks, you smelly little sycophant!")
tr("Heh heh heh. Sorry things didn't work out for you here.")
tr("I don't need to play your petty little games, my cooking speaks for itself!")
tr("Heh heh heh. Well, can't say I didn't try.")
tr("I'll give you my contact info though! You can use me as a reference when you're job hunting.")
tr("(grumble) I already have a job...")
tr("So... Is it true you give out free desserts to people on their birthday?")
tr("Free desserts? Hmm, sure why not. ...We give people free desserts on their birthday, if they pay for them.")
tr("Wait why, is your birthday coming up soon?")
tr("Oh no, no! My birthday's not for sixteen months...")
tr("Sixteen months!?")
tr("You mean... four months?")
tr("You were born on a leap year?")
tr("Sixteen months!? That's an awfully long wait...")
tr("Well, I only celebrate my birthday every other year. I don't deserve to be happy every year, or it gets to my head...")
tr("That would mean your next birthday is in... four months. Right?")
tr("Well, I only celebrate my birthday every other year. I don't deserve to be happy every year, or it gets to my head...")
tr("Oh! Is this one of those leap year things? Like you were born February 29th?")
tr("No, no, nothing like that. I used to celebrate my birthday every year, but now I only celebrate every other year.")
tr("I don't deserve to be happy every year, or it gets to my head...")
tr("Ohh... Well now I feel bad for asking, I didn't know it would be such a long wait.")
tr("...Is there anything we can do? We could charge you for some free desserts if you like.")
tr("Oh really? That would be nice! Thank you... That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me!")
tr("That makes me so happ-- ohhhhh... I guess I should probably scratch out my next birthday...")
tr("...")
tr("Ahh yes, that's a good question.")
tr("I'll get my... business partner to weigh in on this. BUSINESS.")
tr("Sorry, can you remind me why I have to keep saying 'business'?")
tr("(whisper, whisper)")
tr("Ahha ha ha ha! Oh come on. I don't think anybody's going to believe THAT...")
tr("Ohhh, Fat Sensei! Sorry I'm -- I'm reeeally sorry again about messing up your sign.")
tr("Ahhh that's okay. It wasn't your fault, any artist could make that mistake.")
tr("Th-thank you! I don't know what to say.")
tr("That's very understanding")
tr("But... it WAS Tunathy's fault")
tr("It was my fault")
tr("That's very understanding of you, Sensei! I thought you'd be harder on them.")
tr("Well, it's not fair to blame the artist in a case like this.")
tr("Really, Sensei? ...It was all Tunathy's fault, I thought you'd be harder on them.")
tr("Well, it's not fair to blame the artist in a case like this.")
tr("It was my fault anyways. I'm the one who filled out the form wrong.")
tr("No no, don't blame yourself. It was definitely the artist's fault.")
tr("...You see #player#, artists aren't normal people like you and me.")
tr("Years upon years of failing to challenge themselves in any meaningful way shrivels their brain to a subhuman state.")
tr("Why, most artists are lucky if they can even memorize two phone numbers.")
tr("Well... I know my own phone number! And I used to know my old one, before I got a new phone...")
tr("No, no. But artists make up for it in other ways-")
tr("The one quality all real artists share is their courage -- their confidence!")
tr("Their inhuman ability to shake off criticism like water off a duck's back, and to constantly stay productive.")
tr("Yes, that's what truly sets real artists apart from worthless garbage who just sit around and never amount to anything.")
tr("Ohhhhhhhh...")
tr("(Comfort them)")
tr("(Do not)")
tr("...")
tr("... ...")
tr("Sorry, I thought you were going to jump in with some kind of... uplifting anecdote.")
tr("...")
tr("That's okay, Tunathy. You don't need to worry about people like them!")
tr("...")
tr("... ...")
tr("Sorry, I thought you were going to follow that up with some kind of uplifting anecdote.")
tr("Sorry, umm...")
tr("That's the spirit!")
tr("As long as you're happy")
tr("...")
tr("They're a knob")
tr("Fat Sensei's kind of a knob. And to be honest-")
tr("-the more you're disappointing people like them, the more likely it is you're doing something right.")
tr("Oh! ...Th-thanks!")
tr("Don't worry about what other people think! As long as you're happy, that's what counts.")
tr("As long as I'm... Ohhhhh...")
tr("...")
tr("That's the spirit!")
tr("...")
tr("...")
tr("...")
tr("Following the success of their restaurant in Lemony Thickets, Fat Sensei formulated plans for a second location.")
tr("We're already opening a second franchise? Do we have the money for something like that?")
tr("No, but that's why it's located in the desert. This way when it fails, the real estate is cheap and there are no witnesses.")
tr("Isn't this awfully quick? Our first restaurant just barely got off the round. Who's going to keep it running?")
tr("I left it in Sidger's hands, they can handle the restaurant fine by themselves.")
tr("They have our recipes and they'll just hire any help they need.")
tr("Really? Because...")
tr("It seems sudden")
tr("They're not the best")
tr("I could stay behind")
tr("They're not the best chef, and their loyalty is-")
tr("I could stay behind and help them out, until they-")
tr("It seems like maybe they could use a few more weeks to-")
tr("Ah-hahahaha, you worry too much. Focus on your own problems first, smelly.")
tr("Okay.")
tr("...Hey!")
tr("Well... You're not quite as good as 'Closed', but I'll be back again!")
tr("'Turbo Fat'... Hmm... That name is going to take some getting used to.")
tr("Yes, yes... I think that goes for all of us.")
tr("Don't look at me that way! This wasn't my fault. ...Wait... Was it my fault?")
tr("Don't be ridiculous. It was Tunathy's fault! That useless little emotional punching bag.")
tr("Remind me to insult them again later! If I make them cry hard enough, maybe they'll refund our money...")
tr("It wasn't their fault")
tr("Let's play good cop/bad cop")
tr("Cut Tunathy some slack")
tr("Oh poor Tunathy, let's cut them some slack.")
tr("Hmph, you just don't understand how to run a business. If nobody's crying, you're not trying hard enough.")
tr("I want in on this too! Maybe we can do kind of a good cop/bad cop thing.")
tr("No no, you need to start pulling your weight! We both need to be bad cops.")
tr("That's just called good business! If nobody's crying, you're not trying hard enough.")
tr("I don't think it was actually their fault...")
tr("Yes, but with their low self-esteem who do you think they're more likely to believe? Us or themselves?")
tr("That's just called good business! If nobody's crying, you're not trying hard enough.")
tr("Wait... Turbo Fat?")
tr("Yeah, Turbo Fat! That's what you wrote on the form, I triple checked because it sounded so... distinctive.")
tr("I hope Bits 'n' Bites likes what I did with the sign. Do you know when they'll be here?")
tr("No, their name is Turbo Fat! The RESTAURANT'S name is Bits 'n Bites!")
tr("My NAME is Fat Sensei! ...And why is Turbo Fat in big ugly letters over my poorly decorated restaurant!?")
tr("... ...")
tr("Oh no! 'Turbo Fat'? I really liked the food at 'Closed'.")
tr("No no, WE'RE Closed.")
tr("Oh okay. Goodbye then! I guess I'll have to find a new favorite restaurant...")
tr("Just come in and sit down, you idiot!!!")
tr("You still haven't filled out that restaurant form for Tunathy? Here, I'll do it.")
tr("Hmmm... Maybe we should just name the restaurant after you! 'Turbo Fat.'")
tr("First of all, my name is Fat Sensei. Secondly, Turbo Fat is... quite possibly the WORST imaginable name for a restaurant.")
tr("Oh I don't think it's that bad! It evokes a certain sense of...")
tr("Revulsion")
tr("Fear")
tr("Indulgence")
tr("Urgency")
tr("Convenience")
tr("Shamelessness")
tr("A sense of urgency!")
tr("...Yes. Urgency to become fat. Hard pass.")
tr("A sense of indulgence!")
tr("...Yes. Rapid indulgence, which is the most idiotic thing I've ever heard of.")
tr("A sense of convenience!")
tr("...Yes. The convenience of becoming fat. Hard pass.")
tr("A sense of fear!")
tr("...Fear!?")
tr("Yeah, it's just... The danger is in your face, like warning labels on cigarettes!")
tr("...Watch out! Long term use of Turbo Fat has been linked to permanent and irreversible side effects!")
tr("I'm getting the impression you haven't done this kind of thing before.")
tr("A sense of revulsion!")
tr("...Revulsion!?")
tr("Yeah, something like... Eww! Turbo Fat!? Gross, I'll eat ANYWHERE but there!")
tr("I'm getting the impression you haven't done this kind of thing before.")
tr("A sense of shamelessness!")
tr("...Shamelessness!?")
tr("Yeah, something like... Okay our portions are huge, our food is unhealthy, but we're up front about it!")
tr("I'm getting the impression you haven't done this kind of thing before.")
tr("Fine. How about... Bits 'n' Bites?")
tr("Hmm... Yes yes, fine. Whatever. It's marginally better than #bad_restaurant_name#.")
tr("Junjorito")
tr("(scribble, scribble...)")
tr("(scribble, scribble...)")
tr("Oh! What are you writing down?")
tr("Hmm? Just making a sign for our restaurant.")
tr("Oh you thought of a name?")
tr("...")
tr("...'Closed'? I can come up with a better name than that.")
tr("I mean, oh! ...Oh, right. Sorry!")
tr("Heyyy this is that new restaurant I've heard about...? Ooh, 'Closed'! Sounds... exclusive!")
tr("What kind of food do you specialize in?")
tr("Come on in!")
tr("I made the same mistake")
tr("Can you come back later?")
tr("We're literally closed")
tr("Sorry, could you come back later? We're not open right now.")
tr("We're literally closed, as in our restaurant is not open.")
tr("Oh I made the same mistake, but we're ACTUALLY closed. ...Closed as in, not open.")
tr("Come on in! What do you feel like?")
tr("Umm, what #player# MEANT to say is that we're, ahhh... not open right now.")
tr("Hmm so like... 'not open' food? Like burritos? Sure, I could give that a try!")
tr("Wow, our first customer!")
tr("Please go away")
tr("We won't serve you")
tr("I will hurt you")
tr("...Please go away.")
tr("Ha! Ha! Oh it's one of those places that heckles the customers. Go ahead, I can take it! Where's the menu?")
tr("I will hurt you.")
tr("Ha! Ha! Oh it's one of those places that heckles the customers. Go ahead, I can take it! Where's the menu?")
tr("We're not going to serve you, so just leave.")
tr("Ohhhh wow, this place IS really exclusive! ...Can I see a menu?")
tr("Wow, our first customer! Come on in, seat yourself.")
tr("Ahh, what #player# MEANT to say is...")
tr("Please go away, you're dumb and you smell. And please tell your dumb smelly friends to stay away from our restaurant, too.")
tr("Ha! Ha! Oh it's one of those places that heckles the customers. Go ahead, I can take it! Where's the menu?")
tr("Okay... (sigh) We should probably just serve this idiot...")
tr("Wow! We got funding, signed a lease, set up our kitchen and stocked it with food. All in one afternoon!")
tr("...Is there anything left to do?")
tr("Ahh not really! I'm just waiting for this lazy nerd to decorate our restaurant so it doesn't look like a cardboard box.")
tr("I'm not lazy! ...But you haven't told me the restaurant's name yet.")
tr("Kshh, so unprofessional. We talked about the name '#bad_restaurant_name#' don't you remember?")
tr("Junjorito")
tr("I don't think they were there for that conversation, sensei.")
tr("Whatever you come up with, just write it out for me on this form! I don't want to get the spelling wrong.")
tr("And where it says Restauranteur Name, be sure to write-")
tr("-Yes yes, don't worry. I have years of experience making little funny shapes on pieces of paper. I'll handle it.")
tr("Th-thank you!")
tr("Also, umm, it's quite literally not my business but...")
tr("...Please don't call your restaurant #bad_restaurant_name#...")
tr("The name is great")
tr("The name was a joke")
tr("Will you go away!?")
tr("Stop slacking off, you lazy nerd!")
tr("#bad_restaurant_name# is a great name! It matches our restaurant perfectly.")
tr("Really? You're making... THAT kind of restaurant?")
tr("...")
tr("Have you thought about making a good restaurant instead?")
tr("Will you go away!?")
tr("Ack!")
tr("#bad_restaurant_name# was just a joke! ...We'll come up with a better name.")
tr("Oh! ...Okay, phew. I'll just be patient, then.")
tr("...")
tr("So will you come up with a name soon? Or-")
tr("Will you go away!?")
tr("Ack!")
tr("Will you go away!?")
tr("Ack!")
tr("Stop slacking off, you lazy nerd!")
tr("Ack!")
tr("Well that was... good!")
tr("Just good?")
tr("I mean the combos aren't working! It's... I don't think it's your fault, don't take it personally.")
tr("You're... You're doing good. ...You're a good boy.")
tr("Groarf.")
tr("C'mon, let's like... let's get drinks or something, blow off some steam! You did... good today.")
tr("Ohhh. Actually, I really gotta work out tonight. I already missed two nights this week. I can't miss a third night.")
tr("Yeah, you're looking a little chunky")
tr("That's some good discipline!")
tr("Well, can we hang out tomorrow?")
tr("Heh yeah, I thought you were looking a little chunky around the middle.")
tr("W-what!?!")
tr("Ha ha, go exercise.")
tr("Y-yeah, bye!")
tr("Oh good for you, that's some good discipline! ...See you around.")
tr("Bye!")
tr("How about tomorrow then? ...Can we hang out tomorrow?")
tr("Uhhh, I gotta go. See you around!")
tr("Oh! Goodbye!")
tr("Oh hey what's up. I heard you guys came the other day when I wasn't here. So did I miss like anything... important?")
tr("Ahh, nothing important. We're still trying to figure out why this location isn't attracting more customers.")
tr("Yeah, Skins and Bones showed us their cooking skills. ...They seem nice!")
tr("Hah. Yeah they DO seem nice.")
tr("Yeah! ...Umm, wait what? ...I feel like there's something you're not telling me.")
tr("Hah hah. Yeah that's alright, you'll figure it out.")
tr("Umm... Alright. Sounds fun. Anywaaay...")
tr("Why don't you show us your skills in the kitchen! Let's focus on some combos today, if you know about those.")
tr("Yeah yeah! Combos. Sure thing.")
tr("Hmm... so, do you remember that thing I said not to do?")
tr("...")
tr("That thing that you're still doing?")
tr("Mawr...")
tr("You're still doing that thing.")
tr("I know, I know! I'm trying, I really am! ...I'll practice more, I promise.")
tr("It's okay, we're not angry. We're just, umm...")
tr("...Just, just keep practicing. You'll get there.")
tr("Thanks, mowwr...")
tr("Hmm, another restaurant this close!? I wonder if this is a part of the problem.")
tr("What, this place? All they serve is that weird macrobiotic vegan stuff. You don't gotta worry about them.")
tr("We... don't?")
tr("I mean, I'm just thinking long term here.")
tr("Bottom line is when people gotta pick between healthy food and garbage food, the garbage food always wins.")
tr("Y'know I mean. ...No offense.")
tr("Hello, can I um... Oh! ...Wait I've seen you around. You just opened that new \"Turbo Fat\" gym a few doors down, right?")
tr("Yeah it's, actually it's a restaurant!")
tr("Turbo Fat... restaurant? ... ... ...Did you name it that on purpose?")
tr("Well it's a better name than \"Butt Up Cafe\".")
tr("Augh I KNOW! It's obviously \"Buttercup Cafe\" but... this crystal weed is out of control.")
tr("It springs up everywhere, we're calling a landscaping company to come clear it up.")
tr("Ahh, haha. Well. Best of luck.")
tr("Yeah! So um, anyways nice meeting you, and just let us know if you ever need any, um...")
tr("???")
tr("Sorry! This is awkward but, I realized mid-sentence that I didn't want to... help you.")
tr("Like, that makes sense, right? I'm not being selfish?")
tr("Wow! Rude")
tr("...")
tr("That makes sense")
tr("We won't help you either")
tr("...")
tr("Sorry. Bye!")
tr("Yeah, that makes sense.")
tr("Sorry. Bye!")
tr("So that's how it is? ...Fine, we don't want to help you either.")
tr("Sorry. Bye!")
tr("Wow! ...That's a little rude...")
tr("Sorry. Bye!")
tr("So one thing I noticed, Skins, is when you switch from one dish to the next-")
tr("...My name is Bones...")
tr("Oh! Sorry, I'm really awful with names.")
tr("Hey names are tough! You just need a mnemonic to help you keep things straight.")
tr("Like take Skins here, they're sorta like a cat, right? So just remember, \"there's more than one way to skin a cat!\"")
tr("Augh! That's rather graphic!")
tr("And Bones here, they're sorta like a dog? You can remember that like-")
tr("I get it! 'There's more than one way to bone a dog!'")
tr("W-what? ...That's not... ...Well, whatever helps you remember.")
tr("Anyway I know it's been sort of a shaky start, but Fat Sensei and I will teach you everything we can! ...We're pulling for you!")
tr("You're... Pulling for me?")
tr("Well! I guess this is our last day here.")
tr("Yeah! Thanks for all your help. We're putting out better food now, and business is starting to pick up a little.")
tr("Check it out! Three customers!")
tr("Yeah! Ha ha.")
tr("I wish we could figure out why the customers are leaving so fast. There's definitely something.")
tr("I checked your recipes and you're using all the same ingredients, but something's just... different here.")
tr("Something IS different here! But not in a bad way. Even without the customers I just feel... ...nice, you know?")
tr("Maybe it's just being around you guys! I don't really want to leave.")
tr("Well! There's nothing saying we can't help out for another week.")
tr("Let's step up our game and win over a few more customers. What do you say, Bones?")
tr("Bork! Leave it to me!")
tr("Hey, remember a few days ago when you said there's more than one way to bone a dog! Ha ha!")
tr("Ha ha! Yeah. Wait, what's so funny about that?")
tr("Why does everyone keep asking me that!?")
tr("I was thinking maybe if you come over to my place, you can tell me more jokes and then we can get married.")
tr("Yes, I'd love to")
tr("No that's okay")
tr("Umm... I guess")
tr("Yes, yes! Oh, I'd love to marry you, Bones!")
tr("Umm... I guess that's alright.")
tr("N-no, that's okay. I'm not really in the mood for jokes right now.")
tr("Okay! Well, let's just get married then.")
tr("Umm... I can't")
tr("I don't see why not")
tr("No problem at all")
tr("Well, I don't see why not.")
tr("No problem, sounds good.")
tr("Umm, I think I have other plans.")
tr("Let's just marry before your plans! Just a quick marry.")
tr("No reason not to")
tr("Umm... Okay")
tr("I don't want to")
tr("Well, I don't see any reason not to.")
tr("Umm... Okay, whatever.")
tr("...I don't want to marry you. Let's be friends.")
tr("Marry~")
tr("...Friends.")
tr("Maaarrrryyyy~~")
tr("(sigh)")
tr("(You are now in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("Oh boy! Oh boy oh boy oh boy. That is... You're just...")
tr("My mother always warned me not to settle for the first person I fell in love with. And here you are!")
tr("And now I get to call them, and tell them that I have a boyfriend or girlfriend.")
tr("...Actually, I probably should have asked you about that. But, I didn't want to be rude.")
tr("I'm a boy")
tr("I'm a girl")
tr("I love you")
tr("I didn't mean to click that")
tr("I-")
tr("I-")
tr("No, no, don't tell me yet! I can just find out on our honeymoon.")
tr("I love surprises~")
tr("(You are now in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("So are they driving you crazy yet?")
tr("Bones is clingy")
tr("Skins is a bit much")
tr("Who do you mean?")
tr("Skins is... a bit much. They can't seem to take a hint.")
tr("Yeah, that sounds about right. I think I was here for what... two weeks at most when it started.")
tr("Bones became pretty clingy all of a sudden. They can't seem to take a hint.")
tr("Yeah, that sounds about right. I think I was here for what... two weeks at most when it started.")
tr("Is who driving me crazy? I've met a bunch of new people here.")
tr("Oh. Really? No one comes to mind, huh? Well that's nice.")
tr("It sounds like they're taking it easy on you so far. For me, it started like two weeks in.")
tr("I dunno if it's flirting, it's just -- the more you treat them like a human being, the less they treat you like one.")
tr("Every conversation feels like a contest. They squeeze in these awkward compliments whenever they talk to you.")
tr("And they stop farting around you.... And they're always watching you to see what you laugh at, so they can laugh too.")
tr("It's just... (sigh) Whatever. It could be worse.")
tr("I'll fart around you")
tr("That's horrible")
tr("You're so smart")
tr("I've been there")
tr("Hmm")
tr("I'll fart around you!")
tr("Ha ha. Thanks. I think.")
tr("Ugh, that sounds horrible.")
tr("Ahh it's not so bad, just gotta keep those shields up. I'm sure you know the drill.")
tr("Wow, what an insightful monologue. You're so smart! And so beautiful.")
tr("Ha ha. Thanks. I think.")
tr("Yeah... I've been there before.")
tr("Ahh it's not so bad, just gotta keep those shields up. I'm sure you know the drill.")
tr("Hmm...")
tr("Well anyway, it's not so bad. Just gotta keep those shields up. I'm sure you know the drill.")
tr("...Come let me know if you need me to kick 'em in the potato or something.")
tr("Ha ha. Thanks. I think.")
tr("Remember when you said, like, there's more than one way to bone a dog? Ha ha! That was really funny~")
tr("Ha ha! Yeah. Wait, what's so funny about that?")
tr("Why does everyone keep asking me that!?")
tr("Umm! I don't know. I don't remember now! ...So what are you doing later? Did you want to see a movie together?")
tr("It's a date!")
tr("No, I've seen it")
tr("No, I'm busy")
tr("No, that's okay. I think I've already seen that movie...")
tr("You did? Well um... maybe we could watch some dinner instead?")
tr("It's a date!")
tr("No, I've seen it")
tr("No, I'm not hungry")
tr("Oh, That's okay. I think I already have plans tonight...")
tr("You did? Well um... maybe we could get dinner later this week?")
tr("It's a date!")
tr("I'll be busy")
tr("I won't be hungry")
tr("Actually, I think I've already seen that dinner, too...")
tr("Oh I'm not hungry, I just ate lunch...")
tr("Actually, I think I already have plans later this week, too...")
tr("I don't think I'll want dinner later this week! I'll have already eaten such a big lunch...")
tr("Sure, it's a date!")
tr("Okay! ...I love you!")
tr("(You are now in a relationship with Skins.)")
tr("Oh hello. Did you need something?")
tr("Butt's up with you")
tr("You fixed your sign?")
tr("Are you out of business yet")
tr("Hello! Butt's up with you?")
tr("Butt's... Butt's up? What?")
tr("Oh! You fixed your 'butt up cafe' sign. Now my joke doesn't work. Anyway, how's business?")
tr("Right, we fixed that like a WEEK ago! ...But yeah, things have been weird!")
tr("A bunch of our customers just... like... stopped showing up all of a sudden?")
tr("Oh, you fixed your sign!")
tr("Right, we fixed that like a WEEK ago! ...But yeah, things have been weird!")
tr("A bunch of our customers just... like... stopped showing up all of a sudden?")
tr("So are you out of business yet?")
tr("Ugh well. We fixed our sign last week, so at least the 'butt cafe' jokes have stopped.")
tr("But a bunch of our customers just... like... stopped showing up all of a sudden?")
tr("No idea why! And it's not like we have any of their contact info. So... yeah.")
tr("Ah. That's just the worst. I wonder where they could have gone?")
tr("...Yeah. Well. ...How about you, any new customers?")
tr("No, no, don't worry. We're not stealing your customers.")
tr("Ha ha ha, Stealing our customers! ...No, ha ha!")
tr("No, um. I wasn't worried about that. I was just being polite.")
tr("Oh! ...Well thank you.")
tr("Sorry. That probably shouldn't be as funny as it is. Ha ha ha.")
tr("...Your sign looks nice.")
tr("Well... I'm sorry we still couldn't figure out what's wrong with the food here.")
tr("Hey, it ain't your fault! Maybe things are just different here for some reason.")
tr("Something IS different here! But not in a bad way. I don't really want to leave.")
tr("Well! There's nothing saying we can't stay another month.")
tr("Yeah. Stay forever!")
tr("You can just move here!")
tr("Yeah! Another month sounds great.")
tr("Wait... No. No, I'm sorry. Can we talk in private for a moment?")
tr("Ehh yeah! Yeah sure. C'mon guys, lets's take five.")
tr("...#player#, we can't do this to ourselves. They can do this to themselves, but we can't.")
tr("...?")
tr("Don't you see? We have an entire franchise to run.")
tr("It was fun running just one restaurant. A small problem with small solutions.")
tr("And those problems are comfortable because we've solved them before. But that's not the life we chose.")
tr("Once our business grew beyond two or three restaurants... Well, sometimes we have to trust other people to solve the fun problems.")
tr("...")
tr("We have to stop visiting Merrymellow Marsh.")
tr("...But, but!")
tr("But, the restaurant!")
tr("But, I like it here!")
tr("But, my new friends!")
tr("But, my girlfriend!")
tr("But, my boyfriend!")
tr("But-")
tr("-I know you don't want to! I don't want to either.")
tr("But, we have to find new challenges. It'll be better for us in the long run.")
tr("Okay...")
tr("Sorry, I should probably tell you - Fat Sensei and I aren't coming back to MerryMellow marsh for awhile.")
tr("You're not coming back!? Wait! ...Today's your last day?")
tr("No, not today. ...But, some day later this week.")
tr("Wow, oh no! We have to get married soon then.")
tr("Well... no, we probably shouldn't.")
tr("Oh. Groarf.")
tr("Sorry, Bones. You're a special dog. And you'll always have a special place...")
tr("In my potato")
tr("In my heart")
tr("In my thoughts")
tr("In my butt")
tr("On a registry")
tr("In my heart and thoughts")
tr("You'll always have a special place in my heart.")
tr("Well... Thanks. I'm glad I'll always be close to your heart.")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("You'll always have a special place in my thoughts.")
tr("Well... Thanks. I'm glad I'll always be close to your thoughts.")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("You'll always have a special place in my heart, and in my thoughts.")
tr("But... I want you to stay! I don't want hearts and thoughts. Hearts and thoughts, they fade. Fade away.")
tr("...")
tr("Well. Thanks anyways. I'm glad I'll always be close to your heart, and your thoughts.")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("You'll always have a special place in my butt.")
tr("Well... Thanks. I'm glad I'll always be close to your butt.")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("You'll always have a special place in my potato.")
tr("Well... Thanks. I'm glad I'll always be close to your potato.")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("You'll always have a special place on a certain registry somewhere.")
tr("Well... Thanks. I'll think of you every time someone mentions that registry.")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("Sorry, this is hard to say but we were only supposed to be here for one week. And that was like... several weeks ago.")
tr("Fat Sensei and I need to leave for awhile.")
tr("Wahhhh! What about us?")
tr("What? We have a... relationship?")
tr("...")
tr("I could stay")
tr("You could come")
tr("Long distance relationship?")
tr("We should break up")
tr("I guess I could stay here!")
tr("Wh-what!?! ...But you said you were leaving!")
tr("Oh, you're right! I forgot.")
tr("Well, well ummm... We could do the long distance thing, right?")
tr("Like maybe a relationship where we never talk, and we never see each other, and we can date other people...")
tr("...But we're still in a relationship and we still think about each other. What about that?")
tr("You could come with me!")
tr("...Come with you? That's a big step. Couldn't we start with a long-distance relationship?")
tr("Ohh... I don't think that will work out.")
tr("What about a long-distance relationship where we never talk, and we never see each other, and we can date other people...")
tr("...But we're still in a relationship and we still think about each other. What about that?")
tr("I guess we could... try the long distance thing.")
tr("Long distance? Hmm... So maybe, a relationship where we never talk, and we never see each other, and we can date other people...")
tr("...But we're still in a relationship and we still think about each other. Something like that?")
tr("I guess we need to... break up.")
tr("Well what about a long-distance relationship?")
tr("Ohh... I don't think that will work out.")
tr("What about a long-distance relationship where we never talk, and we never see each other, and we can date other people...")
tr("...But we're still in a relationship and we still think about each other. What about that?")
tr("I... what?")
tr("... ...")
tr("Or we break up")
tr("That sounds awful")
tr("That sounds fine")
tr("That... sounds fine.")
tr("Mowr!")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Skins.)")
tr("Or we can just break up.")
tr("Don't worry! I'll just long distance you. ...You don't have to long distance me back. Mowr!")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Skins.)")
tr("No, that sounds awful.")
tr("Don't worry! I'll just long distance you. ...You don't have to long distance me back. Mowr!")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Skins.)")
tr("So I don't know if you've heard, but -- Fat Sensei and I are leaving MerryMellow Marsh for awhile.")
tr("Oh. Yeah, it was only supposed to be a week, right? ...Well, sorry to see you go. This place will suck a little more without you.")
tr("Want to be manager?")
tr("You could leave")
tr("It's not so bad")
tr("It's pretty bad")
tr("Do you want us to make you a manager? You could hire new staff or fix the culture here.")
tr("Wow! Managing. ...I mean even if I hate it here, I don't know if I give enough of a crap to actually try and improve things. Ha ha.")
tr("Yeah, I don't know. I'll probably just let it suck for awhile, see how that goes.")
tr("You could find a new job if things are that bad here. I'm sure you'll land on your feet.")
tr("Yeah, I don't know. Even if I hate it, I'm more the type to stick it out rather than lifting a finger to help myself. Ha ha.")
tr("I'll probably just let it suck for awhile, see how that goes.")
tr("Yeah, sorry, it seems pretty bad. Do you think you'll keep working here?")
tr("Yeah, I don't know. Even if I hate it, I'm more the type to stick it out rather than lifting a finger to help myself. Ha ha.")
tr("I'll probably just let it suck for awhile, see how that goes.")
tr("It doesn't seem so bad! I'm sure you'll get by.")
tr("Yeah, I don't know. Even if I hate it, I'm more the type to stick it out rather than lifting a finger to help myself. Ha ha.")
tr("I'll probably just let it suck for awhile, see how that goes.")
tr("If you weren't happy here, you could change it you know.")
tr("...?")
tr("There are other jobs, easier jobs, better paying jobs. Jobs with less obnoxious coworkers.")
tr("But, I think you're staying because you're happy here. I don't know what your reasoning is, it could be a few things.")
tr("Maybe you enjoy working for a small business, rooting for the underdog and trying to turn things around.")
tr("Maybe you enjoy the attention from your obnoxious coworkers, even if you don't reciprocate it.")
tr("Maybe you enjoy being the most competent employee in a sea of idiots, having people turn to you or view you as a figure of responsibility.")
tr("... ...")
tr("Well. What I'm saying is I'm pretty sure you're happier than you think.")
tr("You need to remind yourself you're happy sometimes. ...You can hurt yourself if you forget that sort of thing.")
tr("...Alright. If I'm ever happy, I'll be sure to let myself know.")
tr("Well, I hate long goodbyes and I think this one's kind of run its course. Take care of yourself.")
tr("You too")
tr("See you around")
tr("Stay in touch")
tr("Stay in touch!")
tr("See you around!")
tr("You too!")
tr("Any news?")
tr("So yeah, I mean... We're trying a few promotions to get people back, but I don't know.")
tr("I HATE marketing, and I always sort of hoped word of mouth would be enough for a place like this?")
tr("And I mean for a while things were going great! ... ...I don't really get what changed....")
tr("Well, maybe people don't like the new name. ...Have you thought about changing it again?")
tr("....Wait, what?")
tr("Switch it back to Butt Up Cafe!")
tr("Shorten it to Butt Cafe!")
tr("Oh, nevermind")
tr("You know, maybe people miss the old Butt Up cafe!")
tr("...")
tr("S-sorry. What? I can't tell if that's a joke or if you're actually making a dig at me.")
tr("I'm not really in the right headspace to parse that right now.")
tr("Ha ha. You'll figure it out.")
tr("Maybe just call it The Butt Cafe this time! You know, shorter! Punchier!")
tr("...")
tr("S-sorry. What? I can't tell if that's a joke or if you're actually making a dig at me.")
tr("I'm not really in the right headspace to parse that right now.")
tr("Ha ha. You'll figure it out.")
tr("Oh... nevermind.")
tr("I had an inappropriate joke, but somehow inappropriate jokes seem inappropriate right now.")
tr("Heh, thanks. ...Hey, keep in touch, okay?")
tr("Well... I guess we're out of here! It was nice meeting all of you.")
tr("Congratulations on the restaurant's success! All your hard work really paid off.")
tr("Us? Heh what are you talking about! You two did all the work.")
tr("Wait, you didn't do anything? ...We didn't do anything either! Did we?")
tr("Well, you and Fat Sensei got all these customers to come!")
tr("Maybe? I talked to two or three of them at most! ...Were they all friends?")
tr("You trained us to cook better! I bet that made a difference too.")
tr("You improved a lot")
tr("You didn't improve")
tr("You got worse")
tr("Yeah! Your cooking's gotten way better. That goes for all of you! I bet that's it.")
tr("I tried to train you but there's only so much I could teach you in such a short time!")
tr("Sorry Skins, I think it was probably something else...")
tr("Skins, somehow your cooking actually got worse after our training. Now that you mention it,")
tr("Something brought in even more customers to make up for the ones you drove away.")
tr("Mowwr...")
tr("I heard the Buttercup Cafe shut down. ...Maybe we just got their leftovers?")
tr("That's great!")
tr("That's interesting")
tr("That's too bad")
tr("They did? Wow! Good riddens to bad restaurants. Did they finally go out of business?")
tr("Yeah! They'd been bleeding customers for awhile now.")
tr("Oh, I didn't know that. ...Did they just go out of business or what?")
tr("Yeah! They'd been bleeding customers for awhile now.")
tr("They did? Oh no! ...I didn't hear about that. Did something happen? Is Diota okay?")
tr("Ehh you didn't know? They'd been bleeding customers for awhile now!")
tr("Pretty sure they burned through their savings and couldn't make rent, it's nothing weird.")
tr("...Like I said before, going head to head the garbage food always wins!")
tr("I mean the uhh... the GOURMET food! Our food.")
tr("Well, whatever it is... A win's a win! I say we take it.")
tr("Goodbye everyone! Thank you for treating my beloved restaurant with care.")
tr("Instead of spending a week in Merrymellow Marsh like they originally planned, Fat Sensei and #player# ended up staying for an entire month.\n\n...But for some, even an entire month wasn't enough.")
tr("I still wish we could have stayed and helped longer. I was finally starting to feel like I belonged there.")
tr("Well, a wise poet once wrote, \"Two sofas diverged in a furniture store.\"")
tr("\"I chose the sofa less comfortable, and that has made all the difference.\"")
tr("I see")
tr("That's stupid")
tr("You made that up")
tr("I see... And Merrymellow Marsh is like one of those big squishy beanbag chairs,")
tr("The kind where you almost pass out in them, and then you have trouble standing up afterwards.")
tr("Yes, something like that.")
tr("Really? A wise poet wrote that?")
tr("...It sounds more like an excuse you made up after buying a crappy sofa.")
tr("Hmph.")
tr("Well that's stupid. Here's a better poem,")
tr("\"Buy some proper furniture and your butt will hurt less, you big wing wong.\"")
tr("Hmph.")
tr("Well, besides that. Did we even do anything while we were there?")
tr("We only finished with a handful of extra customers, and we still don't know why they came.")
tr("They could stop showing up next week, and we'd be back to square one.")
tr("Well. ...For now it's just a handful of customers, but that will change in time.")
tr("There's an old saying, 'even the greatest avalanche starts with a single snowflake.'")
tr("...the GREATEST avalanche?")
tr("Three or four customers now will become thirty or forty.")
tr("And the snowflake becomes a snowball, and the snowball gets bigger...")
tr("Just to be clear, you're using 'GREATEST' in the pejorative sense right? We're not... we're not pro-avalanche!")
tr("...until two or three years later, when our glorious restaurant will have the destructive force to level an entire city!")
tr("Ahha ha ha ha!")
tr("Okay, come on, seriously! ...Use a nicer metaphor! You're being all weird about this.")
tr("Even the greatest... PESTILENCE begins with a single cough!")
tr("What!? No, we have a NICE restaurant! It's not a pestilence!")
tr("Even the greatest MASSACRE begins with...")
tr("STOP! Augh!")
tr("So how was that?")
tr("I think you killed it!")
tr("That was pretty good!")
tr("...")
tr("That was terrible! Are you kidding me?")
tr("Wow, I think you killed it! You have some real talent.")
tr("Whoa, thanks!")
tr("Hey, that was pretty good! And y'know, with a little more training you'll get even better.")
tr("Oh okay cool!")
tr("...")
tr("...?")
tr("... ...")
tr("... ... ...")
tr("That was terrible! Are you kidding me? ...Did you have any cooking experience before this?")
tr("Uhh I mean like, Richie's been helping me figure out the kitchen stuff. ...Did I mess something up?")
tr("Hmm. Yes! Pretty good. Your technique is ahhh... a little off though!")
tr("My... my technique?")
tr("You should focus on the piece of food you're cooking. You don't need to flip all those other pieces beforehand.")
tr("But I have to keep them flipped the same way! Otherwise it makes my head all muddy.")
tr("Well, flipping them slows you down.")
tr("That food should be coming out like pap-|pap-|pap-|pap-|pap!| Right now you're more like pappap,|| pappa| pap.")
tr("You don't want to give your customers any break. Eating should become an unconscious reflex to them, like blinking!")
tr("What I think #player# is trying to say is your technique is ahhh... a little strange.")
tr("My... my technique?")
tr("You should focus on the piece of food you're cooking. You don't need to flip all those other pieces beforehand.")
tr("But I have to keep them flipped the same way! Otherwise it makes my head all muddy.")
tr("Well, flipping them slows you down.")
tr("That food should be coming out like pap-|pap-|pap-|pap-|pap!| Right now you're more like pappap,|| pappa| pap.")
tr("You don't want to give your customers any break. Eating should become an unconscious reflex to them, like blinking!")
tr("Oh, hmm... okay. Mowr...")
tr("Hey hey! Don't worry, we'll work on that. Good work everybody!")
tr("Fat Sensei, #player# -- see what you can do to drum up more business!")
tr("We'll be here when you feel like training us up again. No hurry!")
tr("So explain again why my beloved restaurant is very, very empty?")
tr("Aw come on now! It's not empty, we got the two line cooks here...")
tr("Bork!")
tr("And as far as customers, we got Chonkers McRhonkers over there! What more could you need?")
tr("Hm. Mhm... Well ideally you'd have at least TWO customers...")
tr("Oh Chonkers eats plenty! Even with just them, they're doing a lot to keep us afloat.")
tr("I mean, afloat might be a strong word. They're makin' us sink a little slower I guess.")
tr("Maybe kind of like a, hmm... Like a anchor made of something slightly buoyant.")
tr("An anchor made of... Boats?")
tr("Nope. Not that buoyant!")
tr("Walnuts?")
tr("Rotting flesh?")
tr("Slightly smaller boats?")
tr("This isn't a helpful avenue of discussion.")
tr("Walnuts?")
tr("There you go, well put! Like a anchor made of walnuts.")
tr("Rotting flesh?")
tr("There you go, well put! Like a anchor made of... wait what!?")
tr("...I mean, maybe? ...Hold up, are you on some kind of watchlist I should know about?")
tr("Slightly smaller boats?")
tr("There you go, well put! Like a anchor made of slightly smaller boats.")
tr("This isn't a helpful avenue of discussion.")
tr("Oh sure, I'm with you. ...We'll come back to that one later.")
tr("Well, anyway... I know you said you were following our recipes to a tee. But just in case...")
tr("You want us to show you, right?")
tr("I mean... well...")
tr("Go ahead, Skins! Why don't you show 'em what you got.")
tr("Can do! Mowr!")
tr("Most of the Turbo Fat locations gradually developed a loyal following of hungry customers, except for Merrymellow Marsh where business was unusually slow. Fat Sensei and #player# were on their way to get to the bottom of this mystery.")
tr("So we're supposed to get more customers to show up? Like, with advertising or specials or something?")
tr("...Fat Sensei, I don't know anything about that stuff!")
tr("Oh don't worry, it's probably just something simple they messed up.")
tr("Maybe they're not following our recipes, or they're treating their customers poorly.")
tr("...Or a skunk cemetery?")
tr("...Or they're faking it?")
tr("...Or they hate sweets?")
tr("Or maybe they built the restaurant on a desecrated skunk burial ground!")
tr("An unscrupulous realtor sold them the property sight unseen! And... smell unsmelt!")
tr("Umm... it's probably not that.")
tr("Once we get there, you smell around for skunks! And I'll look for ghosts.")
tr("Or maybe they're cooking poorly on purpose.")
tr("Oh, they're ruining their food for the insurance money! Frightening away customers so they can walk away millionaires.")
tr("Umm... it's probably not that.")
tr("And they'd have gotten away with it if not for us meddling kids!")
tr("Or maybe all the townspeople there hate sweets.")
tr("Oh! Maybe they're fructose intolerant! The merest thought of sugar makes their stomach turn and ruins their poos.")
tr("Umm... it's probably not that.")
tr("I'll design a new healthy menu! Instead of fudge brownies and cheesecake... Pita wedges! And barley bites!")
tr("You know what, I think I'll take the lead on this one.")
tr("What? ...Why?")
