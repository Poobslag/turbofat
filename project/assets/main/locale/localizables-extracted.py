tr("And so #player# and Fat Sensei proceeded to the Zagma gift shop, where #player# purchased their very own Zagma Chef Of The Year plaque for ¥3,000.")
tr("Fat Sensei refused to help pay for the plaque. \"¥3,000 is a considerable investment, it's best you do it yourself.\"")
tr("Hooray! Yay! You did it! Wow!!!")
tr("Chef of the year? Wow, that's amazing!")
tr("Wow, they gave you a plaque and everything!?")
tr("I bought it in the gift shop...")
tr("Yaaaay! New plaque! New plaque!!")
tr("You seem confused. Are you... looking for something?")
tr("I can't find any utensils, do we have a spatula somewhere?")
tr("You don't need a spatula. A real chef cooks with their bare pans.")
tr("Their bare... pans? What about spoons? Forks? Knives?")

tr("Oh no worries, I've engineered a complex system of satellites, receivers, remotes and contraptions to take me home.")

tr("Dusty, is that you? From Lemony Thickets? ...You're an awfully long way from your tree!")
tr("Have we met? You look oddly familiar...")
tr("You don't remember? ...I was one of the squirrels you fed when you were just getting started!")
tr("Although now that you mention it, that does feel like eons ago...")
tr("Oh, right! You're Dusty, aren't you? From Lemony Thickets. ...You're an awfully long way from your tree!")
tr("Yes well, I found myself rather hungry, and you never come to visit your squirrel friends anymore!")

tr("Five minutes ago")
tr("Yesterday")
tr("Yesterday")
tr("A few weeks ago")
tr("A few months ago")
tr("A few eons ago")
tr("I visited you five minutes ago!")
tr("I visited you yesterday!")
tr("I visited you yesterday!")
tr("Hmph well. I don't want to bore you with the details of squirrel biology, but we have to eat nearly every day.")
tr("I visited you a few weeks ago!")
tr("Hmph well. I don't want to bore you with the details of squirrel biology, but we have to eat nearly every week.")
tr("I visited you a month or two ago!")
tr("Hmph well. I don't want to bore you with the details of squirrel biology, but we have to eat nearly every month.")
tr("I visited you ehh... a few eons ago!")
tr("Hmph well. I don't want to bore you with the details of squirrel biology, but we have to eat nearly every eon.")
tr("Sounds cumbersome.")
tr("You don't know the half of it...")
tr("Oh yes, of course! Of course you did. So anyway for my meal, I'll have three chocolate puffs.")
tr("Which, I presume, comes with a complimentary side of BALD-FACED LIES.")
tr("Bald-faced lies. Yes of course! I'll go put in your order... you handsome devil.")
tr("...")
tr("Oh Wendrea, it's you! From the Zagma Chef Of The Year committee.")
tr("Hmm well, I hope for my sake you're enjoying your food! Ha ha~")
tr("Hmph, it tastes like a microwave.")
tr("We don't use microwaves... I cooked that on a stove!")
tr("Well then, you might take a closer look at your stove. Because I think your stove is a microwave.")
tr("Do... Did you want me to make you something else?")
tr("Nah, don't trouble yourself. I'll just take the microcheck.")
tr("Microcheck?")
tr("Fat Sensei, I can't believe you're already on the Zagma Chef Of The Year committee!")
tr("Mmm?")
tr("I mean... is that just something you volunteered for? Can anybody do it?")
tr("Oh no no, it requires decades of training, personal study, grueling trials...")
tr("Culinary versatility, immaculate grooming habits, not to mention the prerequisite of being renowned in the world of gourmet!")
tr("It's one of the most prestigious honors a chef can aspire to.")
tr("Well... if it's so prestigious, why don't we put THAT on the plaque?")
tr("That's way easier")
tr("That's way more impressive")
tr("Our plaque could say...")
tr("Then I wouldn't have to go through all of this chef of the year stuff!")
tr("That's way better than being one of a dozen restaurants with an identical plaque!")
tr("Our plaque could say, \"Our chef is so good, they INVENTED chef of the year!\"")
tr("Ohh, I don't know. If we hang up a flattering plaque like that, people might assume we're talking about you!")
tr("I wouldn't want it to go to your head.")
tr("Oh. I guess.")
tr("We could put up a plaque that applies to both of us! \"Adequate Chef?\"")
tr("...")
tr("\"Unmotivated Chef?\" \"Too Lazy To Get Their Own Plaque Chef?\"")
tr("Okay! Okay!! I get it...")
tr("Oh hey, it's Bart! Our chef from Cannoli Sandbar! What are you doing here?")
tr("Oh hey, it's Bart! Our chef from Cannoli Sandbar! What are you doing here?")
tr("I'm your... chef?")
tr("Are you two from the future, or did I jump timelines again?")
tr("Ah-hahaha. I'll... talk to you about it later.")
tr("Well. I came under the assumption that there was a second, more successful restaurant chain named \"Turbo Fat\"...")
tr("And that this alternate Turbo Fat restaurant had opened a location at this venue.")
tr("...As farfetched as it sounds, it seemed more likely than you two reaching this level of success.")
tr("It's nothing personal, it's just you two always struck me as more of the underdog type.")
tr("Underdog? That's a compliment!")
tr("It's like the saying goes...")
tr("We're not underdogs!")
tr("H-hey! We're not underdogs. We're... plucky up-and-comers!")
tr("Plucky up-and-comer!? Hmph. I didn't agree to this.")
tr("Okay then. ...We're one plucky up-and-comer, and one... frumpy dump-and-downer.")
tr("Yes, that's better. ... ...I think.")
tr("Well... since when is being an underdog a bad thing!? It's like they say uhh... every underdog has its under-day.")
tr("They... don't say that.")
tr("It's an underdog eat underdog world out there!")
tr("Please stop.")
tr("Well it's just like that saying goes... every underdog has its under-day.")
tr("They... don't say that.")
tr("It's an underdog eat underdog world out there!")
tr("Please stop.")
tr("Anyway I see your success didn't come without a cost. ...Why is there cheese in this brownie?")
tr("Oh it's like they say mmm...")
tr("\"When in Roquefort, do as the Roque-mans do.\"")
tr("I... ...see.")
tr("(Psst... I'm not going to have to add cheese to my menu too, am I?)")
tr("(No, that's okay...)")
tr("Oh hello Wendrea! You're back.")
tr("Yes yes, I thought I'd help myself to more of your... microwave cuisine.")
tr("I'll put YOU in a microwave...")
tr("Okay, no microwaves this time")
tr("We don't use a microwave")
tr("I don't know what you're tasting but we definitely don't use a microwave.")
tr("Tsk I ain't talking about your kitchen, I'm talking about YOU, microwave!!!")
tr("Mmmm okay, I'll make doubly sure no microwaves touch your food.")
tr("Tsk 'course there's gonna be a microwave touchin' my food if you're making it, microwave!")
tr("I've like to throw YOU inside a microwave...")
tr("Ohhhhh heh heh heh. Whyyy I bet you say that to all the microwaves.")
tr("Y'know you remind me of myself, back when I was a young microwave.")
tr("Maybe if you wave less and micro more, you might learn a micro something outside of your microwave world.")
tr("I'll... just get your food!")
tr("Wowww look at that! It's JUST like the restaurant in Lemony Thickets!")
tr("Oh hi Tunathy! Yeah, everything's still following all of your designs!")
tr("All the tables, the chairs, the decorations...")
tr("Wow, and you have how many locations now?")
tr("Maybe I should have charged more money... The sign even looks the same! \"Turbo Fat\".")
tr("Hmph yes, and it's thanks to you that we're stuck with that dumb name!")
tr("Ack!!!")
tr("Maybe we should charge YOU more money!")
tr("Please, I already gave you your money back!")
tr("Hmph well that isn't enough! Give me... Give me #player.possessive# money too!!")
tr("#player#, can you, umm... If you have some money I could maybe...")
tr("Ohhhhhh...")
tr("Oh wow, Dreadhark and Goris! You're a long way from Poki Desert.")
tr("...What are you doing here? Aren't you missing Desert Q?")
tr("Aww man, you can't MISS Desert Q. Desert Q is everywhere!")
tr("Umm, it's in a desert")
tr("Umm, that's a logistical nightmare")
tr("Umm, desert is in the name")
tr("Everywhere? I'm pretty sure it's in... a desert?")
tr("Tsk Desert Q isn't about the desert... it's about the whole like... desert vibe!")
tr("Yeah! And I mean volcanoes are like... the desert's distant cousin, am I right?")
tr("I mean we're both sweaty, uncomfortable and in desperate need of a shower...")
tr("...Sounds like a desert to me! Desert KYUUUU!")
tr("Desert KYUUUUUU!")
tr("Everywhere? Then maybe you should take the 'Desert' part out of the name...")
tr("Change the NAME!?")
tr("No way, it's so fun to yell! Desert KYUUUUUU!!")
tr("Desert KYUUUU!!!")
tr("Everywhere? That must be a logistical nightmare.")
tr("Pshh Desert Q isn't about logistics... it's about a union of like umm... man I forget!")
tr("I'm just saying, with billions of attendees, keeping track of-")
tr("Desert KYUUUUUU!")
tr("Desert KYUUUU!!!")
tr("... ...")
tr("But anyway... you'll still have to go back to the end of the line at some point, right?")
tr("We're still IN line. Open your mind, the world is just... one big line! ...I mean queue!!")
tr("Dude you called it a line again!")
tr("The world is one big line? Hmm that's an... interesting philosophy.")
tr("Philosophy? More like an interesting loophole.")
tr("Although, at least now they don't have to worry about leaving the line to eat... or to use the bathroom.")
tr("To use the bathroom? Open your mind, the world is just... one big bathroom!")
tr("Dude. ...Kind of ruining my appetite here.")
tr("S-sorry...")
tr("Mmmm, that was microlicious! I'll waive any disdain I had for this microplace.")
tr("Microthank you")
tr("Was that 'waive' or 'wave'?")
tr("Should I call an ambulance?")
tr("Umm... microthank you.")
tr("Wait, did you mean 'waive' or 'wave'?")
tr("Umm... Should I call an ambulance?")
tr("If you don't mind micro saying, your waveshave looks very micro. Do you like it that wave?")
tr("I've kinda been thinking about shaving MY microwave, y'know, my micro keeps wavin' me about it. Wave wave micro, wave microwave.")
tr("I... I hope you get the help you need.")
tr("Oh Shirts! I haven't seen you since leaving Merrymellow Marsh!")
tr("Oh yeah, hey!")
tr("Are you here to check out the Chocolava Canyon location? I gotta warn you it's pretty much the same food.")
tr("Ha ha pshh yeah, I see! ...I'm within a 2 meter radius of your restaurant, so I must be planning to eat here, is that it?")
tr("It's a big canyon! Lots of cool crap to do other than like, hang out with my amazingly successful friend. Ha ha.")
tr("Pleeeease?")
tr("Sure, go do your cool crap")
tr("I'm busy with my cooler friends anyway")
tr("Yeah sounds good, I'll just let you get on with your cool crap.")
tr("No no, I'm just playing around! I want to catch up, ha ha. How've you been anyway?")
tr("I see you're trying this whole um... ultra-successful, responsible, rich restaurant owner thing. That seems pretty alright.")
tr("Awww pleeeease? PLEEEEEEASE!?")
tr("C'mon have some self respect, ha ha ha!")
tr("If I knew you were THIS desperate to see me I'd have never come by in the first place.")
tr("So anyway how's this whole um... ultra-successful, responsible, rich restaurant owner thing going? That seems pretty alright.")
tr("Yeah, come to think of it I'm busy all day hanging out with my cooler friends.")
tr("No no, I'm just playing around! I want to catch up, ha ha. How've you been anyway?")
tr("I see you're trying this whole um... ultra-successful, responsible, rich restaurant owner thing. That seems pretty alright.")
tr("Yeah you know! It comes with a little responsibility, and it's stressful at times. But overall it's going well.")
tr("How about you, how are things in Merrymellow Marsh?")
tr("Oh yeah, don't worry. Things got WAYYY better after you left! Oh, like, no offense.")
tr("Um, thanks")
tr("Ha ha, c'mon")
tr("...")
tr("Um...")
tr("Ha ha, sounds like I was really holding that place back!")
tr("...")
tr("No no, like – don't get the wrong idea. Things were just rough while you were there and, I was in kind of a bad place...")
tr("Like wait, not BECAUSE you were there! You're great! Umm, hold on... (sigh)")
tr("Y-yeah...")
tr("Ha ha, c'mon")
tr("...")
tr("Y-yeah, I get it...")
tr("Geez c'mon, go easy on me here!")
tr("...")
tr("Okay. One last time.")
tr("It's nice to see you. I'm doing great. ...There, did I do it?")
tr("Got it in one!")
tr("Ha ha anyway I'm gonna go eat something! See you inside~")
tr("Ahh, still struggling with those cheese pieces? They're tricky at first.")
tr("Half of them are too BIG and half of them are too SMALL! These are impossible!!")
tr("Oh I know all about that! But I can tell you some advice that helped me.")
tr("Okay, what's your advice?")
tr("You see, the word 'Boob' looks like boobs in three different ways.")
tr("The upper case 'B' looks like boobs from above. The middle 'oo' looks like boobs from the front. And the last 'b' looks like boobs from the side.")
tr("That's... NOT helpful advice!")
tr("The upper case 'B' look-")
tr("-Stop! STOP! I've already HEARD this advice before!!!")
tr("Oh really? Well, I don't know what else to tell you, I'm sorry!")
tr("(sigh) I need to stop listening to people's advice...")
tr("Wow! I'd say you've officially proven your skills as a world class chef. Well done!!")
tr("Yes definitely! Congratulations!")
tr("That was an ordeal")
tr("Phew, finally")
tr("That's it? That was easy")
tr("Wait, that's it? Because I thought it was gonna be, you know, difficult...")
tr("Ohh, it's harder for most people. I knew you'd blow through it!")
tr("Phew, finally! ...So that's really it? No more surprise challenges?")
tr("That's really it. I knew you had it in you!")
tr("Holy smokes that was an ordeal! ...Did you have to make it so difficult!?")
tr("Ohh, I knew you'd blow through it!")
tr("Ah-hahaha. Congratulations #player#~")
tr("Thanks, Fat Sensei.")
tr("Oh! You still remember my name.")
tr("Your name!? Of course I remember your name.")
tr("...Ha ha. You forget sometimes.")
tr("You're so weird! ...Don't worry. I'll try not to forget.")
tr("...So when do I get my plaque?")
tr("Plaque? Mm-mm, we can't just go givin' away plaques! ...They sell those in the gift shop though.")
tr("Gift shop!?!")
tr("Well this is it, you've used up all your other... ONE chances.")
tr("This is your TRUE last chance!")
tr("What happens if I mess up?")
tr("You seem serious this time")
tr("We're still doing this?")
tr("Only one chance!? ...What happens if I mess up?")
tr("Then that's it! No more chances!! Sorry, we have to remain impartial.")
tr("Wait, really? ...You seem serious this time!")
tr("Of course I seem serious! No more chances! This is it!")
tr("Wow! O-okay.")
tr("We're still doing this?")
tr("Still doing this? You don't seem very intimidated. No more chances! This is it!")
tr("Yes yes, okay.")
tr("Also, you can turn on cheats if you want to, over in the Settings menu.")
tr("Isn't that cheating?")
tr("Will it really count?")
tr("But I'm so close!")
tr("Turn on cheats? Isn't that cheating?")
tr("Yes, cheating is cheating. But that's okay, everybody cheats.")
tr("I don't remember agreeing to this, that they could cheat!")
tr("I want to do it without cheating! I'm so close!")
tr("Mmm that's very honorable of you. But sometimes, it's honorable to know when to cheat, and to know when to not cheat.")
tr("I don't remember agreeing to this, this kind of 'honorable cheat'!")
tr("Oh, I don't know... Will it really count if I cheat?")
tr("Yes, don't worry, it still counts. Everybody cheats a little sometimes.")
tr("I don't remember agreeing to this, that they could cheat!")
tr("Shh! We're staying impartial!")
tr("Can I at least wish them good luck then?")
tr("Mmm, you may not.")
tr("Once again, it's time for... The ultimate test! To prove your skills as a world class chef!")
tr("A trial renowned both for its brutal duration! And blinding speeds! With just... ONE chance!")
tr("What happens if I mess up?")
tr("So that was a practice before?")
tr("You said that last time")
tr("Only one chance!? ...What happens if I mess up?")
tr("One chance! Just one!!! If you mess up, that's it!")
tr("Waaugh!")
tr("Wait, so was last time a practice, and this is it?")
tr("Last time? Practice? Stop talking nonsense! THIS is your last time! There is no practice!")
tr("Oh, um... Okay! I'll do better this time.")
tr("You said I only got one chance last time.")
tr("Well this time... It's REALLY your last chance! No more chances after this one!")
tr("I don't think I believe you...")
tr("Ah-hahahaha!")
tr("Once again I wish you... average luck!")
tr("Thank you, you're too k— ... You're... average kind.")
tr("Well here it is, the ultimate test to prove your skills as a world class chef!")
tr("...")
tr("This one's gonna take awhile!")
tr("Don't worry, there's no cheese pieces or any tricks like that.")
tr("Mmm, but it gets pretty fast too! So keep your wits up.")
tr("Yes yes, and worst of all, you only get ONE chance! Ah-hahaha!")
tr("What happens if I mess up?")
tr("One chance... FOREVER?")
tr("Mmm, yeah right")
tr("Only one chance!? ...What happens if I mess up?")
tr("Oh, don't worry, this is fine. If you can't do it, then we give you another chance tomorrow.")
tr("What? ...Like one chance today, or one chance forever?")
tr("One chance FOREVER! No more chances! This is it!")
tr("Oh, don't worry, this is fine. If you can't do it, then we give you another chance tomorrow.")
tr("Mmm, yeah right.. Is this one of those things where I screw up, and you let me try again later anyway?")
tr("Yes yes don't worry, this is fine. If you can't do it, then we give you another chance tomorrow.")
tr("No! ONE chance! Just one, we have to remain impartial.")
tr("Impartial!? I don't even know them, why do I have to be impartial?")
tr("(glare)")
tr("Ahh... Okay! Okay fine. One chance. ...Good luck!!!")
tr("(glare)")
tr("I can't even say \"Good Luck!?\" Good luck isn't impartial? Fine!")
tr("... ...I wish you... Average luck.")
tr("Umm... I'll do my average-est.")
tr("Everyone really liked the plaque you picked out!")
tr("Well, it feels like the plaque loses some meaning if just anyone can buy one...")
tr("Yes, life is like that. Anyone can buy a plaque in the store!")
tr("And you can get it engraved to say anything you want.")
tr("\"World's least offensive smelling chef!\" It doesn't even have to be true.")
tr("H-hey! I don't smell...")
tr("The plaque's meaning is the meaning you assign it personally. ...What does that plaque mean to you?")
tr("It's a major accomplishment")
tr("It's a nice trophy")
tr("It's nothing special")
tr("It was a waste of time")
tr("It was a waste of time! When I look at it, I think of how much weight I put in it before.")
tr("How I thought all those other restaurants were more prestigious, with better chefs.")
tr("But they were just like us! They just had a little extra money to blow on a meaningless plaque.")
tr("See? That's the meaning. Who cares if you paid ¥3,000 for it? That doesn't change the meaning!")
tr("Now you can look at the plaque and think, \"I'm just as special as those other guys!\"")
tr("It was nothing special! When I look at it, I remember how intimidating those plaques were before.")
tr("How I thought all those other restaurants were more prestigious, with better chefs.")
tr("But they were just like us! They just had a little extra money to blow on a meaningless plaque.")
tr("See? That's the meaning. Who cares if you paid ¥3,000 for it? That doesn't change the meaning!")
tr("Now you can look at the plaque and think, \"I'm just as special as those other guys!\"")
tr("It's a nice trophy! When I look at it, I remember how it felt finally being deemed plaque-worthy.")
tr("Cooking in front of a panel of judges, worrying cooking too slowly or my food not being good enough.")
tr("And then everyone said I did a good job, and well... It just nice to be accepted~")
tr("See? That's the meaning. Who cares if you paid ¥3,000 for it? That doesn't change the meaning!")
tr("Now you can look at the plaque and think, \"People accept me.\"")
tr("Earning that plaque was a major accomplishment! When I look at it, I remember how I didn't give up.")
tr("And I guess on some level, if there's another harder challenge some day...")
tr("Well, it instills me with the confidence that I won't give up next time either.")
tr("See? That's the meaning. Who cares if you paid ¥3,000 for it? That doesn't change the meaning!")
tr("Now you can look at the plaque and think, \"I didn't give up.\"")
tr("I guess! It still feels a little hollow in a way.")
tr("That's sort of a good thing. Set your own harder goals! Buy yourself bigger plaques!")
tr("I bet there's some tougher challenges left if you look for them.")
tr("Ohh, so. Hmm... How do YOU think you did?")
tr("That was hard!")
tr("I blew it")
tr("I did okay")
tr("I did great")
tr("That was so hard!")
tr("Hard!? That was disgraceful! I've seen dogs that poop better than you cook.")
tr("I think I did great!")
tr("Great!? That was disgraceful! I've seen dogs that poop better than you cook.")
tr("I think I did... okay?")
tr("Okay!? That was disgraceful! I've seen dogs that poop better than you cook.")
tr("I think I sort of blew it.")
tr("Sort of blew it!? That was disgraceful! I've seen dogs that poop better than you cook.")
tr("I've never used those cheese pieces before! I guess I'll have to start practicing with them.")
tr("Hahaaaa yeah, those pieces get easier with a little practice!")
tr("My restaurant Carbcraft is next door to yours, so just gimme a shout if you need any advice.")
tr("I have some advice, #player#! ...Have you considered a career in medicine?")
tr("Fat Sensei you're so rude sometimes! #player#, you did great for your first time.")
tr("GREAT!? They did GREAT? Kkkh, be honest!")
tr("A bowl of cereal is \"great\"! #player# served some Grade-A horse molasses, there was nothing great about it...")
tr("Fine yes, you didn't do great. You did mmm...")
tr("... You did okay for your first time.")
tr("... ...You did your first time.")
tr("Thank you. I'm sorry, I have to remain impartial.")
tr("Yeah good job, extremely impartial. I think you broke their heart! Good job.")
tr("Ahh sorry I'm late. I had to use the loo.")
tr("FAT SENSEI!? You're on the committee?")
tr("Ahh... ... yes? And I had to use the loo. I don't hear you making a fuss about that.")
tr("Go easy on me")
tr("You could have told me")
tr("I can't believe you used the loo!")
tr("We're giving ourselves a plaque?")
tr("The loo? The LOO!?! I can't BELIEVE you used the loo! THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!!")
tr("Hmph, too little too late.")
tr("...Just wait and see the muted celebration I deliver next time YOU use the loo!")
tr("...I feel like this is something you could have told me five minutes ago.")
tr("Ah-haha, come now. Where's the theater in that! Let me have my fun~")
tr("So we're jumping through all these hoops, so that we can win a Zagma Chef Of The Year plaque... from OURSELVES?")
tr("I hope you'll at least go easy on me!")
tr("Mwah-hahaha. You'd like that wouldn't you!")
tr("Well, I hope you'll at least go easy on me!")
tr("Mwah-hahaha. You'd like that wouldn't you!")
tr("Oh, do you two know each other already? Will this still be okay?")
tr("Yes yes, don't worry. I'm entirely capable of being impartial.")
tr("Mmmm, I'm not so sure...")
tr("Oh it's no big deal! We weren't actually going to judge them this time anyways.")
tr("#player#, why don't you show us what you can do? This one's just for practice.")
tr("Yes well, I will maybe judge you a little. But maybe not JUDGING you judging you.")
tr("I'LL be judging you judging you! Ah-hahahah!!!")
tr("D-don't be like that!")
tr("As Turbo Fat grew more and more popular, they were finally able to branch out into more competitive venues.")
tr("Their Chocolava Canyon location was their most successful location, always bustling with customers.\n\nBut, they struggled to stand out among other prestigious restaurants nearby.")
tr("Mmm? Did something catch your eye?")
tr("Look at this! This CarbCraft restaurant apparently won \"Zagma Chef Of The Year\" too.")
tr("...I've seen this same plaque at every restaurant here! What the heck is a Zagma Chef of the Year?")
tr("Oh, you haven't heard of Zagma? Because I know everything about Zagma.")
tr("...Really?")
tr("Go on, ask me about Zagma.")
tr("I just don't want our customers thinking that somehow we're bad chefs because we don't have a silly plaque.")
tr("Mmm... Well.")
tr("Getting one of those plaques isn't easy. It will require a considerable investment. But, I can point you in the right direction.")
tr("Can't you win it for me?")
tr("A considerable investment?")
tr("The right direction?")
tr("I can do it myself!")
tr("Can't you just win 'Chef Of The Year' yourself instead? You're already a great chef!")
tr("No no. I have a conflict of interest, it's best if you do it yourself.")
tr("Conflict of interest hmm? I think you're just lazy.")
tr("H-hey! Being lazy is a conflict too...")
tr("A considerable investment? I've been practicing every day for weeks now!! What kind of investment do you mean?")
tr("Ohhh, about ¥3,000 should cover it. Cash is fine~")
tr("Ha ha, nice try...")
tr("...")
tr("Point me in the right direction? ...Because I figured I'd blindly head east again.")
tr("\"Blindly head east again!?\" Hmph don't be so naive. You can't go wandering in a random direction and expect to find anything.")
tr("...But... ...Yes, east is fine.")
tr("Lucky guess~")
tr("Oh I don't need your help! I'll just blindly head east again.")
tr("\"Blindly head east again!?\" Hmph don't be so naive. You can't go wandering in a random direction and expect to find anything.")
tr("...But... ...Yes, east is fine.")
tr("Lucky guess~")
tr("Oh hello! Have you seen someone around here, short and purple? Goes by Turbo?")
tr("Uhh yeah, they were headed back that way! Just keep walking, you can't miss them.")
tr("Idiot, don't just tell them! ...If you act coy, they'll give us snacks.")
tr("What? Oh man! I messed it up again!?")
tr("That's okay! I can make you some snacks.")
tr("Snacks ehh? ...What's in it for us!")
tr("...Ignore my idiot friend here, they're not ehh... not the sharpest shirt in the drawer. We'd love some food.")
tr("Shh, you're blowing it! You have to act coy!!!")
tr("I'll just cook")
tr("I'll just wait")
tr("I'll just leave")
tr("I'm just going to start cooking. You two do whatever you want.")
tr("Maybe we'll eat it and maybe we won't! I'm not telling you anything!")
tr("Namory, the coy part is over! What's wrong with you!?")
tr("I'm just going to wait while you two work this out.")
tr("Maybe we'll work it out and maybe we won't! I'm not telling you anything!")
tr("Namory, the coy part is over! What's wrong with you!?")
tr("I'm just going to leave, you two are confusing me. ...Are you hungry or not!?")
tr("Maybe we're hungry, and maybe we aren't! I'm not telling you anything!")
tr("Namory, the coy part is over! What's wrong with you!?")
tr("Ohhh well... That was more than I should have eaten today.")
tr("It's taking all my energy just to sit up, I don't know HOW I'll manage the walk home...")
tr("WALK home? ...You're a squirrel, don't you live up in a tree?")
tr("...Well, crap.")
tr("Say, I know this is a long shot but ehhh... How's your throwing arm?")
tr("You want me... to THROW you home?")
tr("Just think of it like basketball, like you're lobbing a three pointer into a hoop fifteen meters off the ground!")
tr("It'll be easy! Well, unless you miss... Then you'll have one heck of a mess to clean up.")
tr("I'm... going to go.")
tr("Wait! ...Before you go, can you do one last thing?")
tr("...?")
tr("Perhaps just a quick bite to eat?")
tr("What's wrong with you!!!")
tr("Mara? ...What are you doing here?")
tr("Well... I know you didn't have time to make breakfast! But it turns out I have enough time to follow you around all day!")
tr("...Just cook me something quick, I'll totally get out of your hair!")
tr("You tracked me all the way here just for breakfast? There's a German restaurant a block from our house...")
tr("Ohhh yeah... I kinda forgot that place existed...")
tr("...")
tr("...I mean, I guess I'll walk all the way back there... That's a pretty long walk on an empty stomach...")
tr("Okay fine")
tr("Okay fine")
tr("Okay fine")
tr("Okay fine")
tr("Okay fine fine, stick around and I'll cook you something!")
tr("Now we're talking!")
tr("Okay fine, I'll cook you something... Something indeed! Mwah ha ha ha ha ha!")
tr("Oooh okay! ...Evil laugh meal. Now we're talking!!!")
tr("Okay okay fine, twist my arm why don't you!")
tr("Now we're talking!")
tr("Okay fiiiine, I mean if you're going to make me feel all guilty about it...")
tr("Now we're talking!")
tr("Okay, so tell me everything you know! Who's been feeding you?")
tr("(Chitter, chitter...)")
tr("(Chitter, chitter...)")
tr("They bring us food every day. ...And that's everything we know.")
tr("What!? You see them every day, how could you not know ANYTHING!?")
tr("Well! ...They've never attacked us, and we can't eat them. So, details about their name or appearance fall out of our tiny squirrel brains.")
tr("Their food is delicious though!")
tr("I want the last five minutes of my life back...")
tr("Wow. That is one fat squirrel!")
tr("Excuse me? That's very rude.")
tr("Oh -- I didn't see your friend, sorry. Those are umm, two fat squirrels.")
tr("Thank you.")
tr("And hmm... why are those sticks stuck in the ground?")
tr("Is this a fence post?")
tr("Is this a lawn dart?")
tr("Is this a grave?")
tr("Is this a pigeon?")
tr("Oh, you were mourning your little squirrel friend! That's so sad...")
tr("Oh, you were playing lawn darts! And the cup is to keep score.")
tr("Oh no, someone stole the rest of your fence!")
tr("This one fence post is all that's left. And they left the cup... as a ransom note!")
tr("Oh, it's a giant pigeon! It's buried upside-down, but these two pointy parts are its legs.")
tr("The cup is its umm... tail, and you three are playing a game! Am I close?")
tr("What? No no, nothing like that.")
tr("Someone comes by and leaves food out for us squirrels once a day!")
tr("...But we snuck over early so we could have it to ourselves. Chitter chitter!")
tr("Oh! Hmm... Is this person short and purple? Goes by Turbo?")
tr("Oh! Hmm... Is this person short and purple? Goes by Fat Sensei?")
tr("Maaaaaaybe! ...We'll tell you everything we know, if you feed us.")
tr("Really? You're still hungry!?")
tr("You've got a lot to learn about squirrels...")
tr("Oof, it seems I overate again.")
tr("I'm not going to throw you into your tree, so please don't ask.")
tr("No no, that's alright. I've engineered a system of ropes and pulleys, I can just pull myself up.")
tr("You installed an entire pulley system... just to avoid climbing home after you overeat!?")
tr("That doesn't even make sense. How can someone that lazy also be this motivated?")
tr("...Ah. You've never met an engineer before, have you...")
tr("...")
tr("You again!?")
tr("Sorry! Just a quiiiiiick bite.")
tr("What happened to that German restaurant? I thought they had a nice breakfast.")
tr("I like their food, but this morning they had a line out the door!")
tr("Ohhh I see. ... ...So you're saying, they're too 'kraut-ed'?")
tr("...")
tr("...Nevermind. I've suddenly lost my appetite.")
tr("Get back here!!!")
tr("Oh it's that gravesite again. But there are no squirrels here...")
tr("Hmm, this cup has an inscription! I didn't notice this before. 'We won't forget -- Turbo Fat'.")
tr("Chitter chitter. Aww, we're too early! There's no food yet...")
tr("We'll come back in a little while.")
tr("Oh that's okay! I can make you something quick.")
tr("Hooray!")
tr("So what should we call our new restaurant?")
tr("Hmm yes. Yes yes well, a name is important. It should reflect our identity and set us apart from our competitors.")
tr("I was thinking something like...")
tr("Something like... Junjorito?")
tr("Junjorito")
tr("What on earth is a junjorito?")
tr("I didn't say we had to call it Junjorito! Just something LIKE Junjorito.")
tr("Something like... Caboodles?")
tr("Caboodles")
tr("What on earth is a caboodle?")
tr("You know, like kitten caboodles! Or is it kit 'n caboodles? I don't know... It's just a cute nonsense word!")
tr("Something like... Eaties?")
tr("Eaties")
tr("What on earth is an eatie?")
tr("You know, sort of like foodies... But a friendlier version of it!")
tr("Something like... The Fats of Life?")
tr("The Fats of Life")
tr("Really? You want our restaurant's name to pay homage to a sitcom from what... the 20th century?")
tr("Yeah! It's sort of plays off of your name you know? Because you're Fat Sensei! The Fats of Life!")
tr("Something like... Sparky's?")
tr("Sparky's")
tr("What on earth is a sparky?")
tr("Yeah it's like, a cute little punchy name. Sparky's! Doesn't it sound fun?")
tr("Something like... Smack Dab?")
tr("Smack Dab")
tr("What on earth is a smack dab?")
tr("Oh like that phrase, smack dab in the middle! We'll be smack dab!")
tr("Hmm hmm, yes. Yes, I see your point, we should give our restaurant a really stupid name.")
tr("There aren't a lot of restaurants with stupid names. A name like that could carve out a niche with stupid customers.")
tr("No, not a STUPID name, just something distinctive...")
tr("No, no -- you had it right the first time! Stupid name it is.")
tr("I'll let you come up with it, it seems you have a talent for this.")
tr("Th... thank you? I think...")
tr("Well, you were right. You are a terrible chef.")
tr("Thank you.")
tr("However, your butt speech really spoke to me. Maybe I've been sitting on my butt too much lately, too.")
tr("Well, it would be a shame for someone like you to sit on a butt!")
tr("I suppose it wouldn't be the worst idea to open a restaurant together.")
tr("I could help you with your cooking, and you could help me to not sit on butts.")
tr("That's a great idea")
tr("That's a terrible idea")
tr("I'm not sure")
tr("Oh! Oh wow! That would be great.")
tr("But wait -- isn't opening a restaurant risky? I've heard 90 percent of restaurants fail in their first year...")
tr("I don't think that's a very good idea. I've heard 90 percent of restaurants fail in their first year...")
tr("Hmm maybe? I don't know the first thing about opening a restaurant.")
tr("Like... Isn't it really risky? I've heard 90 percent of restaurants fail in their first year...")
tr("Ahha ha ha! Yes, well. With our concentrated effort and a little luck, maybe we can bring that up to 91 percent.")
tr("Yeah! ...Hey wait...")
tr("(knock knock)")
tr("(knock knock knock knock)")
tr("Do you mind? That's very annoying.")
tr("Sorry! I'm sorry I knocked so many times, but you didn't answer. You're Turbo?")
tr("Mmm yes, of course. I'm Turbo. And your name is...?")
tr("My name is #player#! This may sound weird, but I had a dream about you.")
tr("...I think you're supposed to teach me how to be a great chef!")
tr("Yes yes, I see. My name is Turbo and your name is #player#. That's nice. Goodbye.")
tr("(slam!)")
tr("(knock knock)")
tr("Sorry, I don't have the energy for this today.")
tr("Turbo, you were much nicer in my dream.")
tr("First of all, you should address me as Fat Sensei.")
tr("Second, I was only nice in your dream because we hadn't met before.")
tr("I'll be meaner now that I know how annoying you are.")
tr("(slam!)")
tr("Fat Sensei, I need your help! Being a chef is my dream but I'm terrible at it.")
tr("My roommate's the only one who will eat my cooking, but I think they're only doing it to be nice.")
tr("Everyone else says I should let my hobby be my hobby.")
tr("Even my close friends are pushing me into office jobs, saying I should cook in my free time.")
tr("My parents won't pay for culinary school because they say I won't make a career from it.")
tr("But cooking's the only thing I've ever been passionate about.")
tr("If I can't pursue my dream of cooking I think I just won't pursue any dreams at all.")
tr("I'll just sit on my butt all day reminiscing of days where I also sat on my butt.")
tr("...")
tr("... ...")
tr("Well. ...It would be a shame for someone like you to sit on your butt.")
tr("(sigh) This is probably a mistake. But why don't you show me what you've learned so far.")
tr("Really? Do you mean it?")
tr("After waking from a weirdly informative cooking dream, #player# left in a hurry to find the chef they dreamt about.")
tr("Oh! Wait! ...You're leaving without making your breakfast?")
tr("Oh, sure! I'm not really hungry.")
tr("...So I guess... You're leaving without making my breakfast too?")
tr("...Um that's okay! ...Because you're not really hungry?")
tr("Sorry, I'll make it up to you! I'll make an extra big lunch as a thank you for being such an awesome roommate.")
tr("...It's just, I had a dream last night where a chef taught me some advanced cooking techniques...")
tr("Ooooooh! ...So who is this mystery man? ...Do they have a name?")
tr("The man was...")
tr("The woman was...")
tr("The man, um, woman was...")
tr("Slow down, nosy!")
tr("...So their name was 'Turbo', and I THINK they were a man! ...But I have this weird intuition -")
tr("I think if I run into the forest in a random direction for a long time, I might be lucky enough to bump into them? I guess!")
tr("Well gosh hurry along then!\nI wouldn't want to get in between you and the man of your dreams!")
tr("...So their name was 'Turbo', and I THINK they were a woman! ...But I have this weird intuition -")
tr("I think if I run into the forest in a random direction for a long time, I might be lucky enough to bump into them? I guess!")
tr("Well gosh hurry along then!\nI wouldn't want to get in between you and the woman of your dreams!")
tr("...So their name was 'Turbo', and I don't actually know if they were a man or woman! ...But I have this weird intuition -")
tr("I think if I run into the forest in a random direction for a long time, I might be lucky enough to bump into them? I guess!")
tr("Well gosh hurry along then! I wouldn't want to get in between you and the man slash woman of your dreams!")
tr("...Okay, nosy! I barely know anything about them, except their name was 'Turbo'. ...But I have this weird intuition -")
tr("I think if I run into the forest in a random direction for a long time, I might be lucky enough to bump into them? I guess!")
tr("Well gosh hurry along then! I wouldn't want to get in between you and the man slash woman of your dreams!")
tr("What! Don't say it like that...")
tr("Don't get lost in the forest! Have fun on your timber date.")
tr("...Ugh. ...Come to think of it, you can make your own lunch.")
tr("Wow Tunathy, you brought a sketchbook to the table? I'd be worried about getting food on it...")
tr("Oh this isn't my good sketchbook. I just draw in it for practice...")
tr("Anyway, it's okay. ...You don't need to feign interest in my personal life. I'm really just here to eat...")
tr("Are these your drawings?")
tr("They're pretty good")
tr("They're so messy")
tr("Wow! They're amazing")
tr("It's like those gorillas")
tr("Wow, these look amazing!!")
tr("What? ...Really?")
tr("I had no idea you were this talented! Do you have anything else I can look at?")
tr("I... I don't know how to react to positive attention, can you say something mean?")
tr("I wish I could draw like that...")
tr("Ack! ...Can't ...breathe!")
tr("They're pretty good! I especially like that one.")
tr("What? ...Really?")
tr("I mean it's obvious these are just for practice, but the underlying technique is there. You have such a cool style!")
tr("I... I don't know how to react to positive attention, can you say something mean?")
tr("I wish I could draw like that...")
tr("Ack! ...Can't ...breathe!")
tr("Ohhhh okay, so it's just like... a bunch of messy sketches! Do you have any actual drawings in here?")
tr("Oh! ...Yeah, I'm sorry. This one's just for me. There's nothing finished.")
tr("It's just I've seen sketchbooks from like... REAL artists where it's these elaborately detailed pages...")
tr("Y-yeahhhh, I know. ...This is just something I sketch in for practice.")
tr("I'm kind of surprised you showed this to me! These just look like something you'd throw away. ...No offense!")
tr("Right, no! Um... None taken...")
tr("Oh wow, this reminds me of -- not to change the subject! But I read about this zoo where they had a donation of paintbrushes,")
tr("And they put them in the primate enclosure and let the gorillas paint. Did you ever hear about that?")
tr("Oh, hmmmmm! ...Yeah I think that rings a bell.")
tr("I mean their paintings were just complete and utter garbage, obviously! Because they're just gorillas.")
tr("Well yeah, that makes sense.")
tr("They don't have the same kind of dexterity or spatial awareness that we take for granted.")
tr("Well anyway... I don't know why that came to mind all of a sudden! Thanks for showing me your sketchbook.")
tr("Ohhhh...")
tr("Oh it's you, Mara! Don't worry, this one will be on the house~")
tr("No that's alright, I don't mind paying! I just love that you're hitting it off so well with Fat Sensei.")
tr("So... When are you going to introduce me to your boyfriend?")
tr("So... When are you going to introduce me to your girlfriend?")
tr("So... When are you going to introduce me to your boyfriend and/or girlfriend?")
tr("What!? We're not dating...")
tr("Oh it's fine, I can introduce myself. Hello, I'm Fat Sensei, #player.possessive# partner.")
tr("My BUSINESS partner.")
tr("...Uhh but anyways Fat Sensei, this is my roommate Mara! Well, I don't know if we're technically roommates?")
tr("I cook for them sometimes, and in exchange they let me sleep in their guest room for free.")
tr("Wait. ...Are you serious!?!")
tr("Mara, I mean this in the nicest way possible. I've tasted #player.possessive# cooking. ...They should be paying rent.")
tr("Oh? ...Th-thank you!")
tr("WHAT?! Don't thank them for that!")
tr("I'm sorry! You have a very nice boyfriend. ...Sorry! I mean, 'Partner'.")
tr("I'm sorry! You have a very nice girlfriend. ...Sorry! I mean, 'Partner'.")
tr("I'm sorry! You have a very nice boyfriend and/or girlfriend. ...Sorry! I mean, 'Partner'.")
tr("... (grumble) ...")
tr("So each table should have their food done all at once. Which means when you're cooking it, you should-")
tr("You don't gotta train me, I've got plenty of experience with this sorta thing.")
tr("Oh, like... restaurant experience?")
tr("Nah nah, failed business experience.")
tr("Failed business experience!?")
tr("But we just started!")
tr("You've never worked in a kitchen?")
tr("...Wait, can you cook?")
tr("We're not failing!")
tr("We just got started! We're not failing...")
tr("Oh sure sure! I'm sure your first million is just around the corner. Take my advice though-")
tr("You've never worked in a kitchen?")
tr("What, you think a kitchen's any different than working a call center or mortuary? Take my advice-")
tr("Wait... do you know how to cook?")
tr("I'm not the best, but I'll pick up what I need to. It's not the cooking that's the important part! Take my advice-")
tr("Pshh! Our business isn't failing!")
tr("Oh sure sure! I'm sure your first million is just around the corner. Take my advice though-")
tr("The secret is to half-ass your job, take on JUST enough responsibility to look busy while staying out of trouble.")
tr("That way when things start to go south, you look like a team player and not a liability! It's a delicate balance.")
tr("At least let me teach you the BASICS of cooking...")
tr("Pshh look at you, you little try-hard! You're not gonna last three weeks at a place like this...")
tr("Hey Tunathy! ...So how's your art doing?")
tr("Ohh well... I'm still struggling to find customers.")
tr("But on the bright side, having no work to do gives me plenty of free time to succumb to my irrepressible ennui...")
tr("Marketing yourself is tough")
tr("Enjoy the free time")
tr("All art is subjective, but...")
tr("Well, marketing yourself is tough. I hate doing that kind of stuff, it almost feels arrogant you know?")
tr("One trick some people use is to pretend they're talking about someone else, instead of talking about themselves!")
tr("But even then, it just takes practice really.")
tr("Free time's kind of a blessing in itself! It gives you more time to practice and hone your skills.")
tr("In a few years when you're bombarded with customers, I'm sure you'll wish you had this kind of opportunity again.")
tr("Well... All art is subjective.")
tr("...If people don't like your art, then that means your art is subjectively bad! I wouldn't take it too personally.")
tr("I don't... ...Why are you paying attention to me? Is it because you want me to tip more?")
tr("What's this? I only heard half of the conversation. But yes, we want you to give us more money.")
tr("No we don't! Tunathy, I'm just trying to...")
tr("Cheer you up")
tr("Help you out")
tr("Be your friend")
tr("I'm just trying to be your friend!")
tr("Wait... so you're expressing a genuine interest in my personal life? I'm so confused...")
tr("I'm just trying to help you out.")
tr("Wait... you're expressing a genuine interest in my well-being? I'm so confused...")
tr("I'm just trying to cheer you up!")
tr("Wait... you're expressing a genuine interest in my well-being? I'm so confused...")
tr("Sorry. ...What #player# is trying to explain is, hmm....")
tr("Friends, TRUE friends. True friends give each other money all the time! They don't even think about it.")
tr("You should give us more money, and maybe we'll like you more.")
tr("Well... Sure, that seems fair, let's see how much I got...")
tr("That's not right at all!!! Get out of here.")
tr("(sigh) Don't listen to Fat Sensei! They don't know what they're talking about. Anyways where were we...")
tr("Is five dollars okay?")
tr("...")
tr("So how are you two related? Are you siblings, or...")
tr("Oh, no! We're not related.")
tr("Really? Because the resemblance is uncanny.")
tr("No no. No relation, we're just partners.")
tr("BUSINESS partners.")
tr("Well, that seems redundant...")
tr("It ISN'T.")
tr("Hmm, so long have you been together?")
tr("Been together IN BUSINESS.")
tr("...")
tr("Umm well anyway, I'm going to take off! Good luck with your... ...business.")
tr("Our BUSINESS business.")
tr("Wait -- nope. That one was okay.")
tr("Ahhh Sidger, we had a complaint at table three. Apparently the fudge drops were overdone.")
tr("Nuh-uh, that wasn't me. That was #player.possessive# fault.")
tr("What? No it wasn't!")
tr("Hmm, I see. #player#, try to focus more. These careless mistakes of yours are making you a real liability.")
tr("Sidger, you're so conniving!")
tr("Sensei, you're so gullible!")
tr("This has nothing to do with me")
tr("Look who's at the stove!")
tr("Sidger, you conniving little... munch!")
tr("If you're gonna lie, at least lie about something that matters! Not just, overcooking this one stupid-")
tr("Sensei, how are you this gullible!?")
tr("Sidger's cooked everything today, I've just been coaching them. How would it even make sense for me to-")
tr("This has nothing to do with me, I haven't cooked a single thing today. I've just been watching Sidger-")
tr("Look who's at the stove, they didn't even move an inch! How could you possibly think that I-")
tr("Now now, you shouldn't go around blaming each other. #player#, you need to be more of a team player like Sidger.")
tr("...Remember what I was saying about a delicate balance?")
tr("@#$%!")
tr("...Teach me...")
tr("I'll focus on my cooking")
tr("...Teach me...")
tr("Heh heh heh. Sorry, you're good as done for.")
tr("Why don't you go delicately balance yourself on top of some train tracks, you smelly little sycophant!")
tr("Heh heh heh. Sorry things didn't work out for you here.")
tr("I don't need to play your petty little games, my cooking speaks for itself!")
tr("Heh heh heh. Well, can't say I didn't try.")
tr("I'll give you my contact info though! You can use me as a reference when you're job hunting.")
tr("(grumble) I already have a job...")
tr("So... Is it true you give out free desserts to people on their birthday?")
tr("Free desserts? Hmm, sure why not. ...We give people free desserts on their birthday, if they pay for them.")
tr("Wait why, is your birthday coming up soon?")
tr("Oh no, no! My birthday's not for sixteen months...")
tr("Sixteen months!?")
tr("You mean... four months?")
tr("You were born on a leap year?")
tr("Sixteen months!? That's an awfully long wait...")
tr("Well, I only celebrate my birthday every other year. I don't deserve to be happy every year, or it gets to my head...")
tr("That would mean your next birthday is in... four months. Right?")
tr("Well, I only celebrate my birthday every other year. I don't deserve to be happy every year, or it gets to my head...")
tr("Oh! Is this one of those leap year things? Like you were born February 29th?")
tr("No, no, nothing like that. I used to celebrate my birthday every year, but now I only celebrate every other year.")
tr("I don't deserve to be happy every year, or it gets to my head...")
tr("Ohh... Well now I feel bad for asking, I didn't know it would be such a long wait.")
tr("...Is there anything we can do? We could charge you for some free desserts if you like.")
tr("Oh really? That would be nice! Thank you... That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me!")
tr("That makes me so happ-- ohhhhh... I guess I should probably scratch out my next birthday...")
tr("...")
tr("Ahh yes, that's a good question.")
tr("I'll get my... business partner to weigh in on this. BUSINESS.")
tr("Sorry, can you remind me why I have to keep saying 'business'?")
tr("(whisper, whisper)")
tr("Ahha ha ha ha! Oh come on. I don't think anybody's going to believe THAT...")
tr("Ohhh, Fat Sensei! Sorry I'm -- I'm reeeally sorry again about messing up your sign.")
tr("Ahhh that's okay. It wasn't your fault, any artist could make that mistake.")
tr("Th-thank you! I don't know what to say.")
tr("That's very understanding")
tr("But... it WAS Tunathy's fault")
tr("It was my fault")
tr("That's very understanding of you, Sensei! I thought you'd be harder on them.")
tr("Well, it's not fair to blame the artist in a case like this.")
tr("Really, Sensei? ...It was all Tunathy's fault, I thought you'd be harder on them.")
tr("Well, it's not fair to blame the artist in a case like this.")
tr("It was my fault anyways. I'm the one who filled out the form wrong.")
tr("No no, don't blame yourself. It was definitely the artist's fault.")
tr("...You see #player#, artists aren't normal people like you and me.")
tr("Years upon years of failing to challenge themselves in any meaningful way shrivels their brain to a subhuman state.")
tr("Why, most artists are lucky if they can even memorize two phone numbers.")
tr("Well... I know my own phone number! And I used to know my old one, before I got a new phone...")
tr("No, no. But artists make up for it in other ways-")
tr("The one quality all real artists share is their courage -- their confidence!")
tr("Their inhuman ability to shake off criticism like water off a duck's back, and to constantly stay productive.")
tr("Yes, that's what truly sets real artists apart from worthless garbage who just sit around and never amount to anything.")
tr("Ohhhhhhhh...")
tr("(Comfort them)")
tr("(Do not)")
tr("...")
tr("... ...")
tr("Sorry, I thought you were going to jump in with some kind of... uplifting anecdote.")
tr("...")
tr("That's okay, Tunathy. You don't need to worry about people like them!")
tr("...")
tr("... ...")
tr("Sorry, I thought you were going to follow that up with some kind of uplifting anecdote.")
tr("Sorry, umm...")
tr("That's the spirit!")
tr("As long as you're happy")
tr("...")
tr("They're a knob")
tr("Fat Sensei's kind of a knob. And to be honest-")
tr("-the more you're disappointing people like them, the more likely it is you're doing something right.")
tr("Oh! ...Th-thanks!")
tr("Don't worry about what other people think! As long as you're happy, that's what counts.")
tr("As long as I'm... Ohhhhh...")
tr("...")
tr("That's the spirit!")

tr("...")
tr("Following the success of their restaurant in Lemony Thickets, Fat Sensei formulated plans for a second location.")
tr("We're already opening a second franchise? Do we have the money for something like that?")
tr("No, but that's why it's located in the desert. This way when it fails, the real estate is cheap and there are no witnesses.")
tr("Isn't this awfully quick? Our first restaurant just barely got off the ground. Who's going to keep it running?")
tr("I left it in Sidger's hands, they can handle the restaurant fine by themselves.")
tr("They have our recipes and they'll just hire any help they need.")
tr("Really? Because...")
tr("It seems sudden")
tr("They're not the best")
tr("I could stay behind")
tr("They're not the best chef, and their loyalty is-")
tr("I could stay behind and help them out, until they-")
tr("It seems like maybe they could use a few more weeks to-")
tr("Ah-hahahaha, you worry too much. Focus on your own problems first, smelly.")
tr("Okay.")
tr("...Hey!")
tr("Well... You're not quite as good as 'Closed', but I'll be back again!")
tr("'Turbo Fat'... Hmm... That name is going to take some getting used to.")
tr("Yes, yes... I think that goes for all of us.")
tr("Don't look at me that way! This wasn't my fault. ...Wait... Was it my fault?")
tr("Don't be ridiculous. It was Tunathy's fault! That useless little emotional punching bag.")
tr("Remind me to insult them again later! If I make them cry hard enough, maybe they'll refund our money...")
tr("It wasn't their fault")
tr("Let's play good cop/bad cop")
tr("Cut Tunathy some slack")
tr("Oh poor Tunathy, let's cut them some slack.")
tr("Hmph, you just don't understand how to run a business. If nobody's crying, you're not trying hard enough.")
tr("I want in on this too! Maybe we can do kind of a good cop/bad cop thing.")
tr("No no, you need to start pulling your weight! We both need to be bad cops.")
tr("That's just called good business! If nobody's crying, you're not trying hard enough.")
tr("I don't think it was actually their fault...")
tr("Yes, but with their low self-esteem who do you think they're more likely to believe? Us or themselves?")
tr("That's just called good business! If nobody's crying, you're not trying hard enough.")
tr("Wait... Turbo Fat?")
tr("Yeah, Turbo Fat! That's what you wrote on the form, I triple checked because it sounded so... distinctive.")
tr("I hope Bits 'n' Bites likes what I did with the sign. Do you know when they'll be here?")
tr("No, their name is Turbo Fat! The RESTAURANT'S name is Bits 'n Bites!")
tr("My NAME is Fat Sensei! ...And why is Turbo Fat in big ugly letters over my poorly decorated restaurant!?")
tr("... ...")
tr("Oh no! 'Turbo Fat'? I really liked the food at 'Closed'.")
tr("No no, WE'RE Closed.")
tr("Oh okay. Goodbye then! I guess I'll have to find a new favorite restaurant...")
tr("Just come in and sit down, you idiot!!!")
tr("You still haven't filled out that restaurant form for Tunathy? Here, I'll do it.")
tr("Hmmm... Maybe we should just name the restaurant after you! 'Turbo Fat.'")
tr("First of all, my name is Fat Sensei. Secondly, Turbo Fat is... quite possibly the WORST imaginable name for a restaurant.")
tr("Oh I don't think it's that bad! It evokes a certain sense of...")
tr("Revulsion")
tr("Fear")
tr("Indulgence")
tr("Urgency")
tr("Convenience")
tr("Shamelessness")
tr("A sense of urgency!")
tr("...Yes. Urgency to become fat. Hard pass.")
tr("A sense of indulgence!")
tr("...Yes. Rapid indulgence, which is the most idiotic thing I've ever heard of.")
tr("A sense of convenience!")
tr("...Yes. The convenience of becoming fat. Hard pass.")
tr("A sense of fear!")
tr("...Fear!?")
tr("Yeah, it's just... The danger is in your face, like warning labels on cigarettes!")
tr("...Watch out! Long term use of Turbo Fat has been linked to permanent and irreversible side effects!")
tr("I'm getting the impression you haven't done this kind of thing before.")
tr("A sense of revulsion!")
tr("...Revulsion!?")
tr("Yeah, something like... Eww! Turbo Fat!? Gross, I'll eat ANYWHERE but there!")
tr("I'm getting the impression you haven't done this kind of thing before.")
tr("A sense of shamelessness!")
tr("...Shamelessness!?")
tr("Yeah, something like... Okay our portions are huge, our food is unhealthy, but we're up front about it!")
tr("I'm getting the impression you haven't done this kind of thing before.")
tr("Fine. How about... Bits 'n' Bites?")
tr("Hmm... Yes yes, fine. Whatever. It's marginally better than #bad_restaurant_name#.")
tr("Junjorito")
tr("(scribble, scribble...)")
tr("(scribble, scribble...)")
tr("Oh! What are you writing down?")
tr("Hmm? Just making a sign for our restaurant.")
tr("Oh you thought of a name?")
tr("...")
tr("...'Closed'? I can come up with a better name than that.")
tr("I mean, oh! ...Oh, right. Sorry!")
tr("Heyyy this is that new restaurant I've heard about...? Ooh, 'Closed'! Sounds... exclusive!")
tr("What kind of food do you specialize in?")
tr("Come on in!")
tr("I made the same mistake")
tr("Can you come back later?")
tr("We're literally closed")
tr("Sorry, could you come back later? We're not open right now.")
tr("We're literally closed, as in our restaurant is not open.")
tr("Oh I made the same mistake, but we're ACTUALLY closed. ...Closed as in, not open.")
tr("Come on in! What do you feel like?")
tr("Umm, what #player# MEANT to say is that we're, ahhh... not open right now.")
tr("Hmm so like... 'not open' food? Like burritos? Sure, I could give that a try!")
tr("Wow, our first customer!")
tr("Please go away")
tr("We won't serve you")
tr("I will hurt you")
tr("...Please go away.")
tr("Ha! Ha! Oh it's one of those places that heckles the customers. Go ahead, I can take it! Where's the menu?")
tr("I will hurt you.")
tr("Ha! Ha! Oh it's one of those places that heckles the customers. Go ahead, I can take it! Where's the menu?")
tr("We're not going to serve you, so just leave.")
tr("Ohhhh wow, this place IS really exclusive! ...Can I see a menu?")
tr("Wow, our first customer! Come on in, seat yourself.")
tr("Ahh, what #player# MEANT to say is...")
tr("Please go away, you're dumb and you smell. And please tell your dumb smelly friends to stay away from our restaurant, too.")
tr("Ha! Ha! Oh it's one of those places that heckles the customers. Go ahead, I can take it! Where's the menu?")
tr("Okay... (sigh) We should probably just serve this idiot...")
tr("Wow! We got funding, signed a lease, set up our kitchen and stocked it with food. All in one afternoon!")
tr("...Is there anything left to do?")
tr("Ahh not really! I'm just waiting for this lazy nerd to decorate our restaurant so it doesn't look like a cardboard box.")
tr("I'm not lazy! ...But you haven't told me the restaurant's name yet.")
tr("Kshh, so unprofessional. We talked about the name '#bad_restaurant_name#' don't you remember?")
tr("Junjorito")
tr("I don't think they were there for that conversation, sensei.")
tr("Whatever you come up with, just write it out for me on this form! I don't want to get the spelling wrong.")
tr("And where it says Restauranteur Name, be sure to write-")
tr("-Yes yes, don't worry. I have years of experience making little funny shapes on pieces of paper. I'll handle it.")
tr("Th-thank you!")
tr("Also, umm, it's quite literally not my business but...")
tr("...Please don't call your restaurant #bad_restaurant_name#...")
tr("The name is great")
tr("The name was a joke")
tr("Will you go away!?")
tr("Stop slacking off, you lazy nerd!")
tr("#bad_restaurant_name# is a great name! It matches our restaurant perfectly.")
tr("Really? You're making... THAT kind of restaurant?")
tr("...")
tr("Have you thought about making a good restaurant instead?")
tr("Will you go away!?")
tr("Ack!")
tr("#bad_restaurant_name# was just a joke! ...We'll come up with a better name.")
tr("Oh! ...Okay, phew. I'll just be patient, then.")
tr("...")
tr("So will you come up with a name soon? Or-")
tr("Will you go away!?")
tr("Ack!")
tr("Will you go away!?")
tr("Ack!")
tr("Stop slacking off, you lazy nerd!")
tr("Ack!")
tr("Well that was... good!")
tr("Just good?")
tr("I mean the combos aren't working! It's... I don't think it's your fault, don't take it personally.")
tr("You're... You're doing good. ...You're a good boy.")
tr("Groarf.")
tr("C'mon, let's like... let's get drinks or something, blow off some steam! You did... good today.")
tr("Ohhh. Actually, I really gotta work out tonight. I already missed two nights this week. I can't miss a third night.")
tr("Yeah, you're looking a little chunky")
tr("That's some good discipline!")
tr("Well, can we hang out tomorrow?")
tr("Heh yeah, I thought you were looking a little chunky around the middle.")
tr("W-what!?!")
tr("Ha ha, go exercise.")
tr("Y-yeah, bye!")
tr("Oh good for you, that's some good discipline! ...See you around.")
tr("Bye!")
tr("How about tomorrow then? ...Can we hang out tomorrow?")
tr("Uhhh, I gotta go. See you around!")
tr("Oh! Goodbye!")
tr("Oh hey what's up. I heard you guys came the other day when I wasn't here. So did I miss like anything... important?")
tr("Ahh, nothing important. We're still trying to figure out why this location isn't attracting more customers.")
tr("Yeah, Skins and Bones showed us their cooking skills. ...They seem nice!")
tr("Hah. Yeah they DO seem nice.")
tr("Yeah! ...Umm, wait what? ...I feel like there's something you're not telling me.")
tr("Hah hah. Yeah that's alright, you'll figure it out.")
tr("Umm... Alright. Sounds fun. Anywaaay...")
tr("Why don't you show us your skills in the kitchen! Let's focus on some combos today, if you know about those.")
tr("Yeah yeah! Combos. Sure thing.")
tr("Hmm... so, do you remember that thing I said not to do?")
tr("...")
tr("That thing that you're still doing?")
tr("Mawr...")
tr("You're still doing that thing.")
tr("I know, I know! I'm trying, I really am! ...I'll practice more, I promise.")
tr("It's okay, we're not angry. We're just, umm...")
tr("...Just, just keep practicing. You'll get there.")
tr("Thanks, mowwr...")
tr("Hmm, another restaurant this close!? I wonder if this is a part of the problem.")
tr("What, this place? All they serve is that weird macrobiotic vegan stuff. You don't gotta worry about them.")
tr("We... don't?")
tr("I mean, I'm just thinking long term here.")
tr("Bottom line is when people gotta pick between healthy food and garbage food, the garbage food always wins.")
tr("Y'know I mean. ...No offense.")
tr("Hello, can I um... Oh! ...Wait I've seen you around. You just opened that new \"Turbo Fat\" gym a few doors down, right?")
tr("Yeah it's, actually it's a restaurant!")
tr("Turbo Fat... restaurant? ... ... ...Did you name it that on purpose?")
tr("Well it's a better name than \"Butt Up Cafe\".")
tr("Augh I KNOW! It's obviously \"Buttercup Cafe\" but... this crystal weed is out of control.")
tr("It springs up everywhere, we're calling a landscaping company to come clear it up.")
tr("Ahh, haha. Well. Best of luck.")
tr("Yeah! So um, anyways nice meeting you, and just let us know if you ever need any, um...")
tr("???")
tr("Sorry! This is awkward but, I realized mid-sentence that I didn't want to... help you.")
tr("Like, that makes sense, right? I'm not being selfish?")
tr("Wow! Rude")
tr("...")
tr("That makes sense")
tr("We won't help you either")
tr("...")
tr("Sorry. Bye!")
tr("Yeah, that makes sense.")
tr("Sorry. Bye!")
tr("So that's how it is? ...Fine, we don't want to help you either.")
tr("Sorry. Bye!")
tr("Wow! ...That's a little rude...")
tr("Sorry. Bye!")
tr("So one thing I noticed, Skins, is when you switch from one dish to the next-")
tr("...My name is Bones...")
tr("Oh! Sorry, I'm really awful with names.")
tr("Hey names are tough! You just need a mnemonic to help you keep things straight.")
tr("Like take Skins here, they're sorta like a cat, right? So just remember, \"there's more than one way to skin a cat!\"")
tr("Augh! That's rather graphic!")
tr("And Bones here, they're sorta like a dog? You can remember that like-")
tr("I get it! 'There's more than one way to bone a dog!'")
tr("W-what? ...That's not... ...Well, whatever helps you remember.")
tr("Anyway I know it's been sort of a shaky start, but Fat Sensei and I will teach you everything we can! ...We're pulling for you!")
tr("You're... Pulling for me?")
tr("Well! I guess this is our last day here.")
tr("Yeah! Thanks for all your help. We're putting out better food now, and business is starting to pick up a little.")
tr("Check it out! Three customers!")
tr("Yeah! Ha ha.")
tr("I wish we could figure out why the customers are leaving so fast. There's definitely something.")
tr("I checked your recipes and you're using all the same ingredients, but something's just... different here.")
tr("Something IS different here! But not in a bad way. Even without the customers I just feel... ...nice, you know?")
tr("Maybe it's just being around you guys! I don't really want to leave.")
tr("Well! There's nothing saying we can't help out for another week.")
tr("Let's step up our game and win over a few more customers. What do you say, Bones?")
tr("Bork! Leave it to me!")
tr("Hey, remember a few days ago when you said there's more than one way to bone a dog! Ha ha!")
tr("Ha ha! Yeah. Wait, what's so funny about that?")
tr("Why does everyone keep asking me that!?")
tr("I was thinking maybe if you come over to my place, you can tell me more jokes and then we can get married.")
tr("Yes, I'd love to")
tr("No that's okay")
tr("Umm... I guess")
tr("Yes, yes! Oh, I'd love to marry you, Bones!")
tr("Umm... I guess that's alright.")
tr("N-no, that's okay. I'm not really in the mood for jokes right now.")
tr("Okay! Well, let's just get married then.")
tr("Umm... I can't")
tr("I don't see why not")
tr("No problem at all")
tr("Well, I don't see why not.")
tr("No problem, sounds good.")
tr("Umm, I think I have other plans.")
tr("Let's just marry before your plans! Just a quick marry.")
tr("No reason not to")
tr("Umm... Okay")
tr("I don't want to")
tr("Well, I don't see any reason not to.")
tr("Umm... Okay, whatever.")
tr("...I don't want to marry you. Let's be friends.")
tr("Marry~")
tr("...Friends.")
tr("Maaarrrryyyy~~")
tr("(sigh)")
tr("(You are now in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("Oh boy! Oh boy oh boy oh boy. That is... You're just...")
tr("My mother always warned me not to settle for the first person I fell in love with. And here you are!")
tr("And now I get to call them, and tell them that I have a boyfriend or girlfriend.")
tr("...Actually, I probably should have asked you about that. But, I didn't want to be rude.")
tr("I'm a boy")
tr("I'm a girl")
tr("I love you")
tr("I didn't mean to click that")
tr("I-")
tr("I-")
tr("No, no, don't tell me yet! I can just find out on our honeymoon.")
tr("I love surprises~")
tr("(You are now in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("So are they driving you crazy yet?")
tr("Bones is clingy")
tr("Skins is a bit much")
tr("Who do you mean?")
tr("Skins is... a bit much. They can't seem to take a hint.")
tr("Yeah, that sounds about right. I think I was here for what... two weeks at most when it started.")
tr("Bones became pretty clingy all of a sudden. They can't seem to take a hint.")
tr("Yeah, that sounds about right. I think I was here for what... two weeks at most when it started.")
tr("Is who driving me crazy? I've met a bunch of new people here.")
tr("Oh. Really? No one comes to mind, huh? Well that's nice.")
tr("It sounds like they're taking it easy on you so far. For me, it started like two weeks in.")
tr("I dunno if it's flirting, it's just -- the more you treat them like a human being, the less they treat you like one.")
tr("Every conversation feels like a contest. They squeeze in these awkward compliments whenever they talk to you.")
tr("And they stop farting around you.... And they're always watching you to see what you laugh at, so they can laugh too.")
tr("It's just... (sigh) Whatever. It could be worse.")
tr("I'll fart around you")
tr("That's horrible")
tr("You're so smart")
tr("I've been there")
tr("Hmm")
tr("I'll fart around you!")
tr("Ha ha. Thanks. I think.")
tr("Ugh, that sounds horrible.")
tr("Ahh it's not so bad, just gotta keep those shields up. I'm sure you know the drill.")
tr("Wow, what an insightful monologue. You're so smart! And so beautiful.")
tr("Ha ha. Thanks. I think.")
tr("Yeah... I've been there before.")
tr("Ahh it's not so bad, just gotta keep those shields up. I'm sure you know the drill.")
tr("Hmm...")
tr("Well anyway, it's not so bad. Just gotta keep those shields up. I'm sure you know the drill.")
tr("...Come let me know if you need me to kick 'em in the potato or something.")
tr("Ha ha. Thanks. I think.")
tr("Remember when you said, like, there's more than one way to bone a dog? Ha ha! That was really funny~")
tr("Ha ha! Yeah. Wait, what's so funny about that?")
tr("Why does everyone keep asking me that!?")
tr("Umm! I don't know. I don't remember now! ...So what are you doing later? Did you want to see a movie together?")
tr("It's a date!")
tr("No, I've seen it")
tr("No, I'm busy")
tr("No, that's okay. I think I've already seen that movie...")
tr("You did? Well um... maybe we could watch some dinner instead?")
tr("It's a date!")
tr("No, I've seen it")
tr("No, I'm not hungry")
tr("Oh, That's okay. I think I already have plans tonight...")
tr("You did? Well um... maybe we could get dinner later this week?")
tr("It's a date!")
tr("I'll be busy")
tr("I won't be hungry")
tr("Actually, I think I've already seen that dinner, too...")
tr("Oh I'm not hungry, I just ate lunch...")
tr("Actually, I think I already have plans later this week, too...")
tr("I don't think I'll want dinner later this week! I'll have already eaten such a big lunch...")
tr("Sure, it's a date!")
tr("Okay! ...I love you!")
tr("(You are now in a relationship with Skins.)")
tr("Oh hello. Did you need something?")
tr("Butt's up with you")
tr("You fixed your sign?")
tr("Are you out of business yet")
tr("Hello! Butt's up with you?")
tr("Butt's... Butt's up? What?")
tr("Oh! You fixed your 'butt up cafe' sign. Now my joke doesn't work. Anyway, how's business?")
tr("Right, we fixed that like a WEEK ago! ...But yeah, things have been weird!")
tr("A bunch of our customers just... like... stopped showing up all of a sudden?")
tr("Oh, you fixed your sign!")
tr("Right, we fixed that like a WEEK ago! ...But yeah, things have been weird!")
tr("A bunch of our customers just... like... stopped showing up all of a sudden?")
tr("So are you out of business yet?")
tr("Ugh well. We fixed our sign last week, so at least the 'butt cafe' jokes have stopped.")
tr("But a bunch of our customers just... like... stopped showing up all of a sudden?")
tr("No idea why! And it's not like we have any of their contact info. So... yeah.")
tr("Ah. That's just the worst. I wonder where they could have gone?")
tr("...Yeah. Well. ...How about you, any new customers?")
tr("No, no, don't worry. We're not stealing your customers.")
tr("Ha ha ha, Stealing our customers! ...No, ha ha!")
tr("No, um. I wasn't worried about that. I was just being polite.")
tr("Oh! ...Well thank you.")
tr("Sorry. That probably shouldn't be as funny as it is. Ha ha ha.")
tr("...Your sign looks nice.")
tr("Well... I'm sorry we still couldn't figure out what's wrong with the food here.")
tr("Hey, it ain't your fault! Maybe things are just different here for some reason.")
tr("Something IS different here! But not in a bad way. I don't really want to leave.")
tr("Well! There's nothing saying we can't stay another month.")
tr("Yeah. Stay forever!")
tr("You can just move here!")
tr("Yeah! Another month sounds great.")
tr("Wait... No. No, I'm sorry. Can we talk in private for a moment?")
tr("Ehh yeah! Yeah sure. C'mon guys, let's take five.")
tr("...#player#, we can't do this to ourselves. They can do this to themselves, but we can't.")
tr("...?")
tr("Don't you see? We have an entire franchise to run.")
tr("It was fun running just one restaurant. A small problem with small solutions.")
tr("And those problems are comfortable because we've solved them before. But that's not the life we chose.")
tr("Once our business grew beyond two or three restaurants... Well, sometimes we have to trust other people to solve the fun problems.")
tr("...")
tr("We have to stop visiting Merrymellow Marsh.")
tr("...But, but!")
tr("But, the restaurant!")
tr("But, I like it here!")
tr("But, my new friends!")
tr("But, my girlfriend!")
tr("But, my boyfriend!")
tr("But-")
tr("-I know you don't want to! I don't want to either.")
tr("But, we have to find new challenges. It'll be better for us in the long run.")
tr("Okay...")
tr("Sorry, I should probably tell you - Fat Sensei and I aren't coming back to Merrymellow marsh for awhile.")
tr("You're not coming back!? Wait! ...Today's your last day?")
tr("No, not today. ...But, some day later this week.")
tr("Wow, oh no! We have to get married soon then.")
tr("Well... no, we probably shouldn't.")
tr("Oh. Groarf.")
tr("Sorry, Bones. You're a special dog. And you'll always have a special place...")
tr("In my potato")
tr("In my heart")
tr("In my thoughts")
tr("In my butt")
tr("On a registry")
tr("In my heart and thoughts")
tr("You'll always have a special place in my heart.")
tr("Well... Thanks. I'm glad I'll always be close to your heart.")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("You'll always have a special place in my thoughts.")
tr("Well... Thanks. I'm glad I'll always be close to your thoughts.")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("You'll always have a special place in my heart, and in my thoughts.")
tr("But... I want you to stay! I don't want hearts and thoughts. Hearts and thoughts, they fade. Fade away.")
tr("...")
tr("Well. Thanks anyways. I'm glad I'll always be close to your heart, and your thoughts.")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("You'll always have a special place in my butt.")
tr("Well... Thanks. I'm glad I'll always be close to your butt.")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("You'll always have a special place in my potato.")
tr("Well... Thanks. I'm glad I'll always be close to your potato.")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("You'll always have a special place on a certain registry somewhere.")
tr("Well... Thanks. I'll think of you every time someone mentions that registry.")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Bones.)")
tr("Sorry, this is hard to say but we were only supposed to be here for one week. And that was like... several weeks ago.")
tr("Fat Sensei and I need to leave for awhile.")
tr("Wahhhh! What about us?")
tr("\"Us?\"")
tr("Our relationship!")
tr("What? We have a... relationship?")
tr("...")
tr("I could stay")
tr("You could come")
tr("Long distance relationship?")
tr("We should break up")
tr("I guess I could stay here!")
tr("Wh-what!?! ...But you said you were leaving!")
tr("Oh, you're right! I forgot.")
tr("Well, well ummm... We could do the long distance thing, right?")
tr("Like maybe a relationship where we never talk, and we never see each other, and we can date other people...")
tr("...But we're still in a relationship and we still think about each other. What about that?")
tr("You could come with me!")
tr("...Come with you? That's a big step. Couldn't we start with a long-distance relationship?")
tr("Ohh... I don't think that will work out.")
tr("What about a long-distance relationship where we never talk, and we never see each other, and we can date other people...")
tr("...But we're still in a relationship and we still think about each other. What about that?")
tr("I guess we could... try the long distance thing.")
tr("Long distance? Hmm... So maybe, a relationship where we never talk, and we never see each other, and we can date other people...")
tr("...But we're still in a relationship and we still think about each other. Something like that?")
tr("I guess we need to... break up.")
tr("Well what about a long-distance relationship?")
tr("Ohh... I don't think that will work out.")
tr("What about a long-distance relationship where we never talk, and we never see each other, and we can date other people...")
tr("...But we're still in a relationship and we still think about each other. What about that?")
tr("I... what?")
tr("... ...")
tr("Or we break up")
tr("That sounds awful")
tr("That sounds fine")
tr("That... sounds fine.")
tr("Mowr!")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Skins.)")
tr("Or we can just break up.")
tr("Don't worry! I'll just long distance you. ...You don't have to long distance me back. Mowr!")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Skins.)")
tr("No, that sounds awful.")
tr("Don't worry! I'll just long distance you. ...You don't have to long distance me back. Mowr!")
tr("(You are no longer in a relationship with Skins.)")
tr("So I don't know if you've heard, but -- Fat Sensei and I are leaving Merrymellow Marsh for awhile.")
tr("Oh. Yeah, it was only supposed to be a week, right? ...Well, sorry to see you go. This place will suck a little more without you.")
tr("Want to be manager?")
tr("You could leave")
tr("It's not so bad")
tr("It's pretty bad")
tr("Do you want us to make you a manager? You could hire new staff or fix the culture here.")
tr("Wow! Managing. ...I mean even if I hate it here, I don't know if I give enough of a crap to actually try and improve things. Ha ha.")
tr("Yeah, I don't know. I'll probably just let it suck for awhile, see how that goes.")
tr("You could find a new job if things are that bad here. I'm sure you'll land on your feet.")
tr("Yeah, I don't know. Even if I hate it, I'm more the type to stick it out rather than lifting a finger to help myself. Ha ha.")
tr("I'll probably just let it suck for awhile, see how that goes.")
tr("Yeah, sorry, it seems pretty bad. Do you think you'll keep working here?")
tr("Yeah, I don't know. Even if I hate it, I'm more the type to stick it out rather than lifting a finger to help myself. Ha ha.")
tr("I'll probably just let it suck for awhile, see how that goes.")
tr("It doesn't seem so bad! I'm sure you'll get by.")
tr("Yeah, I don't know. Even if I hate it, I'm more the type to stick it out rather than lifting a finger to help myself. Ha ha.")
tr("I'll probably just let it suck for awhile, see how that goes.")
tr("If you weren't happy here, you could change it you know.")
tr("...?")
tr("There are other jobs, easier jobs, better paying jobs. Jobs with less obnoxious coworkers.")
tr("But, I think you're staying because you're happy here. I don't know what your reasoning is, it could be a few things.")
tr("Maybe you enjoy working for a small business, rooting for the underdog and trying to turn things around.")
tr("Maybe you enjoy the attention from your obnoxious coworkers, even if you don't reciprocate it.")
tr("Maybe you enjoy being the most competent employee in a sea of idiots, having people turn to you or view you as a figure of responsibility.")
tr("... ...")
tr("Well. What I'm saying is I'm pretty sure you're happier than you think.")
tr("You need to remind yourself you're happy sometimes. ...You can hurt yourself if you forget that sort of thing.")
tr("...Alright. If I'm ever happy, I'll be sure to let myself know.")
tr("Well, I hate long goodbyes and I think this one's kind of run its course. Take care of yourself.")
tr("You too")
tr("See you around")
tr("Stay in touch")
tr("Stay in touch!")
tr("See you around!")
tr("You too!")
tr("Any news?")
tr("So yeah, I mean... We're trying a few promotions to get people back, but I don't know.")
tr("I HATE marketing, and I always sort of hoped word of mouth would be enough for a place like this?")
tr("And I mean for a while things were going great! ... ...I don't really get what changed....")
tr("Well, maybe people don't like the new name. ...Have you thought about changing it again?")
tr("....Wait, what?")
tr("Switch it back to Butt Up Cafe!")
tr("Shorten it to Butt Cafe!")
tr("Oh, nevermind")
tr("You know, maybe people miss the old Butt Up cafe!")
tr("...")
tr("S-sorry. What? I can't tell if that's a joke or if you're actually making a dig at me.")
tr("I'm not really in the right headspace to parse that right now.")
tr("Ha ha. You'll figure it out.")
tr("Maybe just call it The Butt Cafe this time! You know, shorter! Punchier!")
tr("...")
tr("S-sorry. What? I can't tell if that's a joke or if you're actually making a dig at me.")
tr("I'm not really in the right headspace to parse that right now.")
tr("Ha ha. You'll figure it out.")
tr("Oh... nevermind.")
tr("I had an inappropriate joke, but somehow inappropriate jokes seem inappropriate right now.")
tr("Heh, thanks. ...Hey, keep in touch, okay?")
tr("Well... I guess we're out of here! It was nice meeting all of you.")
tr("Congratulations on the restaurant's success! All your hard work really paid off.")
tr("Us? Heh what are you talking about! You two did all the work.")
tr("Wait, you didn't do anything? ...We didn't do anything either! Did we?")
tr("Well, you and Fat Sensei got all these customers to come!")
tr("Maybe? I talked to two or three of them at most! ...Were they all friends?")
tr("You trained us to cook better! I bet that made a difference too.")
tr("You improved a lot")
tr("You didn't improve")
tr("You got worse")
tr("Yeah! Your cooking's gotten way better. That goes for all of you! I bet that's it.")
tr("I tried to train you but there's only so much I could teach you in such a short time!")
tr("Sorry Skins, I think it was probably something else...")
tr("Skins, somehow your cooking actually got worse after our training. Now that you mention it,")
tr("Something brought in even more customers to make up for the ones you drove away.")
tr("Mowwr...")
tr("I heard the Buttercup Cafe shut down. ...Maybe we just got their leftovers?")
tr("That's great!")
tr("That's interesting")
tr("That's too bad")
tr("They did? Wow! Good riddens to bad restaurants. Did they finally go out of business?")
tr("Yeah! They'd been bleeding customers for awhile now.")
tr("Oh, I didn't know that. ...Did they just go out of business or what?")
tr("Yeah! They'd been bleeding customers for awhile now.")
tr("They did? Oh no! ...I didn't hear about that. Did something happen? Is Diota okay?")
tr("Ehh you didn't know? They'd been bleeding customers for awhile now!")
tr("Pretty sure they burned through their savings and couldn't make rent, it's nothing weird.")
tr("...Like I said before, going head to head the garbage food always wins!")
tr("I mean the uhh... the GOURMET food! Our food.")
tr("Well, whatever it is... A win's a win! I say we take it.")
tr("Goodbye everyone! Thank you for treating my beloved restaurant with care.")
tr("Instead of spending a week in Merrymellow Marsh like they originally planned, Fat Sensei and #player# ended up staying for an entire month.\n\n...But for some, even an entire month wasn't enough.")
tr("I still wish we could have stayed and helped longer. I was finally starting to feel like I belonged there.")
tr("Well, a wise poet once wrote, \"Two sofas diverged in a furniture store.\"")
tr("\"I chose the sofa less comfortable, and that has made all the difference.\"")
tr("I see")
tr("That's stupid")
tr("You made that up")
tr("I see... And Merrymellow Marsh is like one of those big squishy beanbag chairs,")
tr("The kind where you almost pass out in them, and then you have trouble standing up afterwards.")
tr("Yes, something like that.")
tr("Really? A wise poet wrote that?")
tr("...It sounds more like an excuse you made up after buying a crappy sofa.")
tr("Hmph.")
tr("Well that's stupid. Here's a better poem,")
tr("\"Buy some proper furniture and your butt will hurt less, you big wing wong.\"")
tr("Hmph.")
tr("Well, besides that. Did we even do anything while we were there?")
tr("We only finished with a handful of extra customers, and we still don't know why they came.")
tr("They could stop showing up next week, and we'd be back to square one.")
tr("Well. ...For now it's just a handful of customers, but that will change in time.")
tr("There's an old saying, 'even the greatest avalanche starts with a single snowflake.'")
tr("...the GREATEST avalanche?")
tr("Three or four customers now will become thirty or forty.")
tr("And the snowflake becomes a snowball, and the snowball gets bigger...")
tr("Just to be clear, you're using 'GREATEST' in the pejorative sense right? We're not... we're not pro-avalanche!")
tr("...until two or three years later, when our glorious restaurant will have the destructive force to level an entire city!")
tr("Ahha ha ha ha!")
tr("Okay, come on, seriously! ...Use a nicer metaphor! You're being all weird about this.")
tr("Even the greatest... PESTILENCE begins with a single cough!")
tr("What!? No, we have a NICE restaurant! It's not a pestilence!")
tr("Even the greatest MASSACRE begins with...")
tr("STOP! Augh!")
tr("So how was that?")
tr("I think you killed it!")
tr("That was pretty good!")
tr("...")
tr("That was terrible! Are you kidding me?")
tr("Wow, I think you killed it! You have some real talent.")
tr("Whoa, thanks!")
tr("Hey, that was pretty good! And y'know, with a little more training you'll get even better.")
tr("Oh okay cool!")
tr("...")
tr("...?")
tr("... ...")
tr("... ... ...")
tr("That was terrible! Are you kidding me? ...Did you have any cooking experience before this?")
tr("Uhh I mean like, Richie's been helping me figure out the kitchen stuff. ...Did I mess something up?")
tr("Hmm. Yes! Pretty good. Your technique is ahhh... a little off though!")
tr("My... my technique?")
tr("You should focus on the piece of food you're cooking. You don't need to flip all those other pieces beforehand.")
tr("But I have to keep them flipped the same way! Otherwise it makes my head all muddy.")
tr("Well, flipping them slows you down.")
tr("That food should be coming out like pap-|pap-|pap-|pap-|pap!| Right now you're more like pappap,|| pappa| pap.")
tr("You don't want to give your customers any break. Eating should become an unconscious reflex to them, like blinking!")
tr("What I think #player# is trying to say is your technique is ahhh... a little strange.")
tr("My... my technique?")
tr("You should focus on the piece of food you're cooking. You don't need to flip all those other pieces beforehand.")
tr("But I have to keep them flipped the same way! Otherwise it makes my head all muddy.")
tr("Well, flipping them slows you down.")
tr("That food should be coming out like pap-|pap-|pap-|pap-|pap!| Right now you're more like pappap,|| pappa| pap.")
tr("You don't want to give your customers any break. Eating should become an unconscious reflex to them, like blinking!")
tr("Oh, hmm... okay. Mowr...")
tr("Hey hey! Don't worry, we'll work on that. Good work everybody!")
tr("Fat Sensei, #player# -- see what you can do to drum up more business!")
tr("We'll be here when you feel like training us up again. No hurry!")
tr("So explain again why my beloved restaurant is very, very empty?")
tr("Aw come on now! It's not empty, we got the two line cooks here...")
tr("Bork!")
tr("And as far as customers, we got Chonkers McRhonkers over there! What more could you need?")
tr("Hm. Mhm... Well ideally you'd have at least TWO customers...")
tr("Oh Chonkers eats plenty! Even with just them, they're doing a lot to keep us afloat.")
tr("I mean, afloat might be a strong word. They're makin' us sink a little slower I guess.")
tr("Maybe kind of like a, hmm... Like a anchor made of something slightly buoyant.")
tr("An anchor made of... Boats?")
tr("Nope. Not that buoyant!")
tr("Walnuts?")
tr("Rotting flesh?")
tr("Slightly smaller boats?")
tr("This isn't a helpful avenue of discussion.")
tr("Walnuts?")
tr("There you go, well put! Like a anchor made of walnuts.")
tr("Rotting flesh?")
tr("There you go, well put! Like a anchor made of... wait what!?")
tr("...I mean, maybe? ...Hold up, are you on some kind of watchlist I should know about?")
tr("Slightly smaller boats?")
tr("There you go, well put! Like a anchor made of slightly smaller boats.")
tr("This isn't a helpful avenue of discussion.")
tr("Oh sure, I'm with you. ...We'll come back to that one later.")
tr("Well, anyway... I know you said you were following our recipes to a tee. But just in case...")
tr("You want us to show you, right?")
tr("I mean... well...")
tr("Go ahead, Skins! Why don't you show 'em what you got.")
tr("Can do! Mowr!")
tr("At the Merrymellow Marsh Turbo Fat location, business was once again unusually slow. This situation was starting to feel familiar...")
tr("...However unlike the other Turbo Fat locations, there were plenty of people around!\n\nIt just seemed like none of them were very hungry.")
tr("So we're supposed to get more customers to show up? Like, with advertising or specials or something?")
tr("...Fat Sensei, I don't know anything about that stuff!")
tr("Oh don't worry, it's probably just something simple they messed up.")
tr("Maybe they're not following our recipes, or they're treating their customers poorly.")
tr("...Or there's a skunk cemetery?")
tr("...Or they're faking it?")
tr("...Or they hate sweets?")
tr("Or maybe they built the restaurant on a desecrated skunk burial ground!")
tr("An unscrupulous realtor sold them the property sight unseen! And... smell unsmelt!")
tr("Umm... it's probably not that.")
tr("Once we get there, you smell around for skunks! And I'll look for ghosts.")
tr("Or maybe they're cooking poorly on purpose.")
tr("Oh, they're ruining their food for the insurance money! Frightening away customers so they can walk away millionaires.")
tr("Umm... it's probably not that.")
tr("And they'd have gotten away with it if not for us meddling kids!")
tr("Or maybe all the townspeople there hate sweets.")
tr("Oh! Maybe they're fructose intolerant! The merest thought of sugar makes their stomach turn and ruins their poos.")
tr("Umm... it's probably not that.")
tr("I'll design a new healthy menu! Instead of fudge brownies and cheesecake... Pita wedges! And barley bites!")
tr("You know what, I think I'll take the lead on this one.")
tr("What? ...Why?")
tr("My stomach hurts, but I want to keep eating... Ohhhhh.... This might be my new favorite restaurant...")
tr("Oooof.... I'm gonna leave an online review! Right after I deal with the aftermath of my own terrible, terrible decisions...")
tr("...See? Our food's good enough to cancel out whatever weird leaps of morality you have to justify to yourself.")
tr("So, don't overthink it. At the end of the meal, we're happy and our customers are happy. It's win/win.")
tr("I still don't like it")
tr("I didn't get to lie")
tr("I should have told them")
tr("My stomach hurts, but I want to keep eating... Ohhhhh.... This might be my new favorite restaurant...")
tr("Hey sorry, I know we said we'd save your places in line but we didn't do that. I hope you're not mad...")
tr("Our places in... what? Ohhhh yeah we gotta get back in line, dude.")
tr("Probably gotta go back to the end again... Desert Q...")
tr("...See? Our food's good enough to cancel out whatever weird leaps of morality you have to justify to yourself.")
tr("So, don't overthink it. At the end of the meal, we're happy and our customers are happy. It's win/win.")
tr("I still don't like it")
tr("I should have lied")
tr("I'm telling them again")
tr("Fine, you're right. But I still don't have to like it.")
tr("Well. ...You don't HAVE to like it. But you should try liking it! You'll sleep a little better~")
tr("Aww but that's no fun! I wanted to make up a really cool lie.")
tr("Oh don't worry! You'll have plenty of other opportunities to lie to our customers, you... weird little sociopath.")
tr("That wasn't as fun as I expected. Maybe I should have told them a really cool lie.")
tr("Oh don't worry! You'll have plenty of other opportunities to lie to our customers, you... weird little sociopath.")
tr("Maybe I should have told them the truth...")
tr("Oh don't worry, I'm sure you'll have plenty of other opportunities to ruin everything with the stupid truth.")
tr("Hmph, I'm going to go tell them the truth again! Maybe they didn't hear...")
tr("Oh don't worry, I'm sure you'll have plenty of other opportunities to ruin everything with the stupid truth.")
tr("You're back!? ...Does this line go in a circle?")
tr("Tsk, we lost our place last time. We had to go back to the end.")
tr("Maaaaaan, I really liked your food too! But I don't wanna step out of line again. Desert Q...")
tr("...Desert Q...")
tr("Mmmm, we'll save your place in line. Go on inside!")
tr("Really, you'd do that? Sweet, it's on then!")
tr("I'm getting one of them chocolate puffs!!")
tr("You're really going to wait in line for them?")
tr("No, and neither are you! ...Go cook.")
tr("You think of a lie")
tr("What lie should we make up?")
tr("Won't they be mad?")
tr("That seems dishonest... Won't they be mad?")
tr("No they won't be mad. If you do your job they won't be anything!")
tr("Do you think they're going to remember any of our promises when their stomachs are full and their brains are empty?")
tr("Lying is fun")
tr("I'm telling them")
tr("I don't like this")
tr("Well... We should think of some kind of a lie, right?")
tr("Hmph. You're assuming they're going to remember anything that happened in the past thirty seconds.")
tr("...If you do your job, they'll be sprawled out in their respective food comas and we won't have to make up a thing.")
tr("Lying is fun")
tr("I'm telling them")
tr("I don't like this")
tr("Okay, I'll cook! You think of a lie.")
tr("A lie? It's bold of you to assume they'll remember anything that happened in the past thirty seconds.")
tr("...If you do your job, they'll be sprawled out in their respective food comas and we won't have to lie about a thing.")
tr("Lying is fun")
tr("I'm telling them")
tr("I don't like this")
tr("Mmmm... Yeah. I don't like this.")
tr("Fine whatever, go ahead and dislike whatever you want to dislike.")
tr("I'm going to go hide in the back and put on my \"I Told You So\" pants.")
tr("Lying to customers is fun!")
tr("Ahha ha ha ha, yes it is. But we're not going to have to lie, just wait and see!")
tr("You worry about the cooking, I'll go hide in the back and put on my \"I Told You So\" pants.")
tr("I'm telling them the truth!")
tr("Hmph, you can tell them whatever you want after you finish cooking for them.")
tr("...In the meantime, I'll go hide in the back and put on my \"I Told You So\" pants.")
tr("Heck yeah, those were some seriously choice chocolate puffs! Sorry for bugging you about the whole nut thing.")
tr("Ahhaha, trust me. It was no trouble~")
tr("Fat Sensei, that was still dangerous. You're lucky they didn't have an allergic reaction!")
tr("Hmph. Here's a secret about food -- nobody's allergic to anything.")
tr("\"Allergic\" is just a word people use for emphasis, like the word \"literally\". If you don't believe me, let's ask Raymon over here.")
tr("Raymon, I'm afraid there was a mix-up in the kitchen. This is important -- are you LITERALLY allergic to nuts?")
tr("Nuts? Oh yeah, I'm literally allergic to them! Like, literally could not be more allergic.")
tr("Umm like I bit into this walnut brownie the other day and I LITERALLY had to brush my teeth afterwards.")
tr("I didn't actually brush my teeth 'cause my cat was in my lap! But you know how it is.")
tr("Yes, yes. Everyone's allergic to everything until a cat's in their lap.")
tr("I'm allergic to cats")
tr("Some day the cat will be in the other lap")
tr("You should brush your teeth")
tr("Fat Sensei, some day the cat's going to be in the OTHER lap.")
tr("I... don't know what that means.")
tr("You know EXACTLY what it means!")
tr("I'm... allergic to cats.")
tr("Well see, now you're just being mean to cats!")
tr("No I don't DISLIKE cats! I just... Ack, you're impossible!")
tr("Cat or no cat, you should really brush your teeth...")
tr("Well see, now you're just being mean to cats!")
tr("How is THAT being mean to cats!?")
tr("Hey so these chocolate puffs... They don't have nuts do they? 'Cause I'm allergic to nuts.")
tr("Yes, they have nuts")
tr("No, they don't have nuts")
tr("I'm not sure...")
tr("Actually, they do have nuts!")
tr("What? Why would you tell them they have nuts!?")
tr("No, they don't have nuts.")
tr("Hmmm, I'm not sure if they have nuts or not...")
tr("Don't worry. Everything on our menu is nut free. Our chef even wears an athletic cup.")
tr("Oh okay! Right on.")
tr("Fat Sensei, is that actually true?")
tr("What, you mean about the athletic cup?")
tr("About everything!")
tr("Yes? No. I don't know. I don't really keep track of that sort of thing.")
tr("...Besides, it's not like a food allergy ever killed anyone.")
tr("Don't look at me that way!")
tr("Lisk, nobody's going to pay you to see the big cactus...")
tr("But it's a REALLY big cactus!")
tr("Are you two talking about the big cactus in front of our restaurant?")
tr("...That's my cactus. But I'll sell it to you~")
tr("... ... ...")
tr("Seeeeee, Beats? Any idiot can say it's their cactus. And besides, I can talk way louder than THAT person.")
tr("(grumble...)")
tr("So your food must be amazing! I've had this place recommended to me by like... fiiiiive different people!")
tr("Really? People are talking about us?")
tr("Yep! The place next to the big cactus. Is it ummmm.. Is it true you save people's place in line?")
tr("No")
tr("I'm not sure...")
tr("Yes")
tr("Yes! That's... apparently true.")
tr("Oh okay, thank goodness! Because I already paid them outside, and I didn't want it to turn into this big thing.")
tr("I'm not sure...")
tr("Oooh then we may have a little problem, because I already paid them outside, so if I get back in line, hmm...")
tr("Umm sorry, we don't do that...")
tr("Oooh then we may have a little problem, because I already paid them outside, so if I get back in line, hmm...")
tr("Wait you paid... them? The... line people? You have to pay someone before you can wait in line?")
tr("No no no -- it's not like you pay beforehand or anything. They have this online payment system.")
tr("Online payment?")
tr("Yep. ... ...Someone walks up to you on the line, and you pay them! Ha ha ha~")
tr("So is someone going to take my order? Orrrrrrr...")
tr("I'll take your order")
tr("If we have to")
tr("Get out")
tr("They're allergic to puns")
tr("Get out.")
tr("...?")
tr("Ugh. If we have to...")
tr("...?")
tr("I'll take your order! Don't worry about Fat Sensei, they're umm... literally allergic to puns.")
tr("...?")
tr("You'll have to excuse Fat Sensei, they're umm... literally allergic to puns.")
tr("...?")
tr("So this double chocolate cheesecake... Is this vegan? I've been trying to go vegan lately.")
tr("Yes yes, everything on the menu is vegan.")
tr("Really? ...'cause it's a caaaaaake, so what do you use instead of eggs? And butter?")
tr("Oh yes our recipe doesn't use COW butter, it's hmm... GOAT butter!")
tr("Goats... aren't vegan.")
tr("P-peanuts?")
tr("Peanut... butter? Hmm that sounds healthy! ...What about the eggs?")
tr("Yes #player#, what ABOUT the eggs?")
tr("Rocks")
tr("Smoke")
tr("Peanuts")
tr("Sand")
tr("Eggs")
tr("Milkweed")
tr("...Peanut eggs?")
tr("...Sand eggs?")
tr("...Smoke eggs?")
tr("...Rock eggs?")
tr("...Milkweed eggs?")
tr("We use real eggs.")
tr("\"Real Eggs?\" Ohhhhhh so is that sort of like... like the \"Impossible Burger\" but for eggs?")
tr("Oooh sounds tasty. I'll have that!")
tr("I feel so dirty...")
tr("Don't worry. It gets easier every time~")
tr("So what's your impression of Desert Q so far?")
tr("I'm confused")
tr("It makes sense")
tr("It seems dumb")
tr("I love it")
tr("It seems sort of... dumb. You just stand around in the desert for 7 days and don't actually do anything.")
tr("Heh yeah! You're not alone. When I tell most people about it, they just think it seems dumb.")
tr("I'm sort of... confused by it. It sounds like you just stand around for 7 days and don't actually do anything.")
tr("Wait up really? A bunch of people standing in the desert for 7 days, and you're confused by that?")
tr("'Cause when I tell most people about it, they just think it just seems dumb.")
tr("It makes sense to me. You hang out with your friends and do nothing! A big week-long party with no obligations.")
tr("Wait up really? A bunch of people standing in the desert doing nothing for 7 days, and that makes sense to you?")
tr("'Cause when I tell most people about it, they just think it just seems dumb.")
tr("It's great, I'd love to stand around outside with my friends for an entire week!")
tr("Wait up really? A bunch of people standing in the desert doing nothing for 7 days, THAT'S what you aspire to?")
tr("'Cause when I tell most people about it, they just think it just seems dumb.")
tr("Goris, I'm like a thousand years old so EVERYTHING seems dumb.")
tr("But you're not hurting anyone and it seems like you're having fun.")
tr("There comes a time in everyone's life when they're no longer fun enough to be dumb.")
tr("A time when you sit in a boring chair every day and you are very boring and you feel very smart.")
tr("So, if you're still at the age where you're dumb enough to have fun, then well...")
tr("...I think that in itself is worth celebrating. Go be dumb! Life is too short.")
tr("Heck yeah thanks!")
tr("Now if you'll pardon me, I'ma go dumb it up with my friends. Peace~")
tr("I'm still confused")
tr("Have fun with your dumb friends")
tr("It still makes sense")
tr("I still love it")
tr("Desert Q does seem dumb! Go have fun with your dumb friends.")
tr("Whoa! Where did THAT come from!?")
tr("Whoaaaaaa that was out of line, #player#! You know, words can hurt sometimes.")
tr("But... But I...")
tr("Well, I'm still a little confused by it...")
tr("Maaaaaaan you're not supposed to understand it! It's just this dumb thing we all do once a year, ha ha.")
tr("But don't worry about it! Fat Sensei gets it. And you, you got another year to figure it out. Take it easy~")
tr("Well, it still makes sense to me! I'd love to join you next year.")
tr("Maaaaaaan it's not supposed to make sense! It's just this dumb thing we all do once a year, ha ha.")
tr("But don't worry about it! Fat Sensei gets it. And you, you got another year to figure it out. Take it easy~")
tr("I still love everything about Desert Q! I love the line... And I love the umm...")
tr("There's just too many things to name! I love them all.")
tr("Maaaaaaan you're not supposed to love it! It's just this dumb thing we all do once a year, ha ha.")
tr("But don't worry about it! Fat Sensei gets it. And you, you got another year to figure it out. Take it easy~")
tr("Sooooo, did everyone enjoy their food?")
tr("Mmmmm, yeah that was delicious!")
tr("Soooo good. You can really taste the #vegan_food_1# #vegan_food_2#!")
tr("smoke")
tr("nuts")
tr("Mmm, yes. W-wait. ...#vegan_food_1.capitalize# #vegan_food_2#?")
tr("It gets easier every time")
tr("I need to be alone")
tr("They pressured me")
tr("Ha ha ha! Like you said, it gets easier every time...")
tr("I... I think I need to be alone...")
tr("It's... It's not my fault! ...They pressured me!")
tr("Ooh this fudge blondie looks good! And it doesn't have milk either, right?")
tr("Well it's not COW milk, it comes from umm...")
tr("Grass")
tr("Milkweed")
tr("Pickles")
tr("Rocks")
tr("Nuts")
tr("From nuts!")
tr("nuts")
tr("Nut... milk?")
tr("Y-yeah!")
tr("Aww did you say nut milk? I'm allergic to nuts!")

tr("From grass!")
tr("grass")
tr("Grass... milk?")
tr("Y-yeah!")
tr("Aww did you say grass milk? I'm allergic to grass!")
tr("N-no this isn't like... REGULAR grass! This is SPECIAL grass harvested from um...")
tr("Sand")
tr("Fish")
tr("Goats")
tr("Crabs")
tr("Smoke")
tr("From... goats? Well I mean... imitation goats. Of course.")
tr("goat")
tr("From... smoke? Well I mean... imitation smoke. Of course.")
tr("smoke")

tr("fish")
tr("From... sand? Well I mean... imitation sand. Of course.")
tr("sand")
tr("From... crabs? Well I mean... imitation crabs. Of course.")
tr("crab")
tr("Imitation #vegan_food_1# #vegan_food_2#? Oh that sounds healthy!")
tr("...It does? Well, I guess it kind of does...")
tr("This place is pretty nice! So you two, what, co-own it or something?")
tr("Maybe... Who are you anyways?")
tr("Oh sorry! I was just curious about your business. I'm Trudy, I handle the only payment system for Desert Q.")
tr("Oh! We've heard about Desert Q...")
tr("Yes, yes -- some kind of... gathering of the greatest minds, something like that?")
tr("Heck if I know! I just walk around and act important, and people give me money for doing nothing.")
tr("It's probably a lot like what you do here! People just show up and give you money, right?")
tr("Well we... USUALLY bring them food... Hint, hint...")
tr("Hmm hmm, yes, bringing people food. That sounds like way too much work for me! Doing nothing's way easier.")
tr("But then I do like the idea of having a building to stay cool in. Do you mind if I open my own business next door?")
tr("Hmph well. It's a free cactus.")
tr("Wait. What kind of business?")
tr("Oh hey what are you doing here? No cutsies!")
tr("We were just curious what you and Goris were up to. ...We didn't see you for a few days.")
tr("Well you caught us just in time, my friend!")
tr("We were just enjoying our shining moment at the front before we grabbed a bite to eat.")
tr("Yeah! Sucks we gotta get out of the desert line though.")
tr("Dude, why you always callin' it a line? You know it's a queue. Desert QUEUE!")
tr("Aww my bad, ha ha! Desert QUEUE!")
tr("Desert QUEUE!?")
tr("I'm going to kill someone")
tr("There's nothing here?")
tr("Wait... This is the front of the line? There's nothing here!")
tr("What do you mean there's nothing here? WE'RE here dude!")
tr("Heck yeah we are!")
tr("Wait, it's called desert QUEUE? Like a queue people wait in!?!")
tr("I... I think I'm going to kill someone.")
tr("I think this was like... the best Desert Q ever! So many memories...")
tr("Getting in line with everyone... Going home... I can't wait for next year! Desert KYUUU!")
tr("Desert Q!! Y'know, I heard someone saying there was once a FESTIVAL at the front of the queue.")
tr("...Must have been nice...")
tr("... ...")
tr("...What if there was a restaurant at the front of the queue?")
tr("Go on...?")
tr("Imagine an ordered set of vertices...")
tr("A certain dining establishment?")
tr("Our restaurant")
tr("Turbo Fat")
tr("The term 'queue' is mathematically ambiguous, but let's imagine an ordered set of vertices...")
tr("If the set were ordered by distance, they might converge on a point of interest, a notable location such as...?")
tr("A certain dining establishment that might come to mind?")
tr("...OUR restaurant?")
tr("Turbo Fat. They mean Turbo Fat.")
tr("I'm following, keep going?")
tr("If each participant is a point in a directed graph...")
tr("The line could go to...?")
tr("This could be a line for Turbo Fat")
tr("Ugh, I give up")
tr("If each member of the line is a point in a directed graph, we could redirect the graph without moving the points...")
tr("While the graph would directing its members to an arbitrary location, that arbitrary location could redefined... as...?")
tr("Riiight...? I think I'm with you?")
tr("You mean like... redirecting a semi-commutative digraph with an arbitrary terminal vertex? ...Keep going, what else?")
tr("What if this line could go someplace... more interesting? A certain place to eat?")
tr("Riiight...? I think I'm with you?")
tr("What if the line went to Turbo Fat?")
tr("Riiight...? I think I'm with you?")
tr("I give up. Just... Ask Goris. I think they get it.")
tr("Hmm, so I should ask someone... I think I'm with you. ...Keep going, what else?")
tr("Just get everyone to follow me, you idiots...")
tr("Alright! (claps) Bring it around everyone, the queue's going this way!!")
tr("Fat Sensei, I was just serving those guests and they said Thursday is the last day of Desert Q!")
tr("Interesting. ...You know, I was just serving THOSE guests and they said Monday is the Hamburglar's birthday!")
tr("You don't seem concerned")
tr("We might go out of business")
tr("No, that's Wednesday")
tr("What? ...The Hamburglar's birthday isn't Monday, it's Wednesday!")
tr("You... don't seem very concerned.")
tr("Oh I'm very concerned! That's why I'm double-checking it on the internet...")
tr("(tap, tap... tap type... swipe...)")
tr("We might go out of business... but at least we know the Hamburglar's birthday.")
tr("Oh-ho ho, you might THINK that... But that's why I'm double-checking it on the internet...")
tr("(tap, tap... tap type... swipe...)")
tr("WHAT!? I can't believe I actually believed them. This is an outrage!!")
tr("If you'll pardon me, I have to teach a toddler some VERY grown-up words.")
tr("I hope it's not the same toddler as last time...")
tr("Oh hey Lisk! What's going on, Desert Q's just seven days right? Didn't it end a few days ago?")
tr("Oh you know how it is. Seven days became eight days, and a few of us missed our flights home.")
tr("Then we missed our makeup flights, and then we set up some tents outside.")
tr("You set up... tents?")
tr("And then a bunch of us kind of got hooked on the food here, which... Can you blame us?")
tr("Anyway, I'll probably go home in a few weeks, or months, or... You know, whenever.")
tr("That seems weird, don't you have...")
tr("Pets?")
tr("A significant other?")
tr("Friends?")
tr("Responsibilities?")
tr("Don't you have pets?")
tr("Psh whatever. Don't YOU have pets?")
tr("Don't you have friends?")
tr("Psh whatever. Don't YOU have friends?")
tr("Don't you have a significant other?")
tr("Psh whatever. Don't YOU have a significant other?")
tr("Don't you have responsibilities?")
tr("Psh whatever. Don't YOU have responsibilities?")
tr("...Umm. Touche?")
tr("Well, we do have other locations.")
tr("That sounds like way too much work for me! Three vanilla puffs please.")
tr("And gimme some extras, I'll take 'em home to my tent-mates.")
tr("Hooray! More customers!")
tr("I'm glad you're staying, but...")
tr("This behavior seems obsessive")
tr("This behavior seems obsessive! You can't upend your life just because you found a new favorite place to eat.")
tr("I mean, I'm glad everyone's sticking around, but I'm worried it's for kind of the wrong reasons...")
tr("Hooray! I wasn't sure if we'd survive without customers, but it sounds like they're here for good.")
tr("They've even improvised some kind of a shanty town!")
tr("Right? I wasn't expecting our food to provoke such in-tents cravings.")
tr("...")
tr("With a steady stream of customers in Poki Desert, Fat Sensei already had plans for a third location. But #player# was suspicious of their good fortune.")
tr("So that was an awfully big coincidence...")
tr("Opening our new restaurant in the PERFECT location to attract a huge untapped influx of customers.")
tr("But isn't it short-sighted for us to leave so suddenly?")
tr("Mmm? I don't follow.")
tr("What happens next week?")
tr("What about our staff?")
tr("What about our customers?")
tr("What happens next week, when Desert Q is over?")
tr("Oh, you don't need to worry about that kind of stuff.")
tr("Next week's problems are next week's problems.")
tr("What about our staff, Who's going to run the restaurant?")
tr("Oh, you don't need to worry about that kind of stuff.")
tr("I hired someone to fill in while we're gone, probably. I don't remember.")
tr("What about our customers, won't they stop coming eventually?")
tr("Oh, you don't need to worry about that kind of stuff.")
tr("Who needs customers anyways? Customers, shmustomers.")
tr("I see... Well that takes care of every possible loose end! Everything worked out perfectly.")
tr("Yes yes. Everything seemed to just fall into place didn't it?")
tr("Did you even know about Desert Q before our first day there?")
tr("Oh! Umm. Yes? Maybe. ...My motives are umm... complex. Mwahha ha ha ha~")
tr("Your motives sound like you're throwing a dart at a map.")
tr("My motives are more complex than THAT! And besides, darts are scary and pointy...")
tr("M-hm. Sure. So where did the dart land this time?")
tr("Ah, just a delicious destination called the \"Flan Islands\"")
tr("Oooh, that sounds nice!")
tr("Wait... no... Not the \"Flan Islands\"... the \"Kflab Islands\". Hmph. Stupid autocorrect!")
tr("...So you were saying about your complex motives?")
tr("I mean, I ummm... I autocorrected it on purpose! Mwahha ha ha ha ha... ...")
tr("...Oh, whatever.")
tr("I heard someone say you'll save our place in line. Is that true?")
tr("Yes, yes, #player# would be happy to shave your faceless swine.")
tr("Wait, what!? That's not what I -")
tr("#player#, can you handle this? There are three tables which need my attention.")
tr("Why are we so busy all of a sudden!? This was supposed to be a desert.")
tr("...So, umm... did you hear my question?")
tr("Yes, we'll do that")
tr("No, we won't do that")
tr("Lead me to the swine")
tr("A table just opened up")
tr("Lead me to the swine!")
tr("That's... that's incredibly rude.")
tr("...")
tr("We might have a table that just opened up! If you don't mind sitting on someone else's cheek-prints...")
tr("Umm... thanks, I guess...")
tr("I can tell you with utmost honesty that nobody will save your place in line.")
tr("But if you're lucky, you won't remember asking us? So it's sort of win/win.")
tr("Umm... thanks, I guess...")
tr("Yes, we'll save your place. ...But, sometimes the people in line won't believe you!")
tr("You might have to assertively force your way in and be rude to them after your meal.")
tr("Umm... thanks, I guess...")
tr("Look at all these customers!")
tr("Wow! That line goes on forever.")
tr("Ahha ha ha. Remember when you complained that this place was \"literally deserted?\"")
tr("I guess you feel pretty silly about that now.")
tr("It WAS deserted")
tr("It IS desert-ed")
tr("It IS dessert-ed")
tr("I was wrong")
tr("It WAS literally deserted, I wasn't wrong! It just became... less deserted since then.")
tr("That's an understatement! You're going to have to learn to cook faster.")
tr("If I cook faster, won't I be making it even MORE deserted?")
tr("Hmm?")
tr("You know... Because of all the new DESSERTS! Get it? Dessert-ed?")
tr("It IS literally desert-ed! Think about it.")
tr("Hmm?")
tr("It's literally deserted, because we're LITERALLY in a desert. ...That's what literally is SUPPOSED to mean.")
tr("Oh phew, I thought you meant like... \"Dessert-ed\", as in... ...")
tr("Well if you think about it... It is literally dessert-ed!")
tr("Hmm?")
tr("You know... Because of all of our DESSERTS! Get it? Dessert-ed?")
tr("I was wrong...")
tr("Yes yes, don't feel bad. At some point, everybody but me is wrong. You'll get used to it~")
tr("But anyways, it is still literally deserted.")
tr("Hmm?")
tr("You know... Because of all of our DESSERTS! Get it? Dessert-ed?")
tr("Oh... Oh no. Desserts? Dessert QUEUE!?! What have I done!!")
tr("I'm going to be sick")
tr("Don't feel bad")
tr("That's pretty funny")
tr("You're right, it is a dessert queue! That's pretty funny~")
tr("It's not funny, it's terrible. Horrifying! ...And... the pun was right there the whole time!?")
tr("How many people did I put in danger through my... my unthinkable negligence? There were families. Children!!!")
tr("Oh lighten up, Fat Sensei.")
tr("...I'm afraid we need to shut down this location.")
tr("Nooooooo...")
tr("Eughhh, I think I'm going to be sick...")
tr("This is terrible. Horrifying! ...And... the pun was right there the whole time!?")
tr("How many people did I put in danger through my... my unthinkable negligence? There were families. Children!!!")
tr("So many lives ruined...")
tr("I'm afraid we need to burn down this location.")
tr("It's for the best. I'll forge the necessary insurance paperwork...")
tr("Oops! Well, umm... this sort of thing could happen to anyone. Don't feel bad about it...")
tr("Don't feel BAD about it!? This is terrible. Horrifying! ...And... the pun was right there the whole time!?")
tr("How many people did I put in danger through my... my unthinkable negligence? There were families. Children!!!")
tr("Oh lighten up, Fat Sensei.")
tr("...I'm afraid we need to shut down this location.")
tr("Nooooooo...")
tr("So tell me more about this... Desert Q festival?")
tr("Aww man, Desert Q's not just a festival! It's a gathering of minds!")
tr("The world's greatest creatives, all celebrating the spirit of Desert Q!")
tr("Desert Q!")
tr("Yes but... What are you celebrating exactly? ...And how do you celebrate it?")
tr("Pshh we're celebrating the spirit of the greatest minds! All gathering in the desert for seven days! C'mon.")
tr("Are there... bands? Or events?")
tr("This isn't just like, some dumb concert here! It's the world's GREATEST minds we're talking about!")
tr("We gather and umm... Like have you seen the line? It's a REALLY big line!")
tr("Wait a minute Dreadhark, look outside! I think we lost our place!")
tr("Aww what! Desert Q!!!")
tr("Desert Q!!!")
tr("...Umm! ...Tell your friends about us!?")
tr("What the heck!? Where did all these people come from!")
tr("Desert KYUUUUUU!")
tr("Desert KYUUUUUU!")
tr("Clearly they're here for... 'Desert Q'?")
tr("What's Desert Q? Some kind of big festival?")
tr("This is your first Desert Q!? Well, think of it as a seven-day celebration with the world's greatest creatives...")
tr("A special gathering where we can all get together and celebrate the spirit of Desert Q!")
tr("Mmmm... can we get you something to eat while you wait?")
tr("Heck yeah let's grub up! Desert Q!!!")
tr("Desert Q! That's what I'm talkin' about.")
tr("Fat Sensei and #player# arrived at their new location in Poki Desert, ready to start their first day, but...")
tr("Wait, THIS is Poki Desert!?")
tr("When you said 'desert' I assumed you meant 'Hot Place With People In It'... This place is literally deserted!")
tr("Oh come now. LITERALLY deserted?")
tr("Yes. LITERALLY DESERTED. There are NO people.")
tr("Hmph, well WE'RE here, aren't we?")
tr("You don't count as a person")
tr("Your pedantry is ever-helpful")
tr("Yay, our problems are solved")
tr("You're right, our problems are solved! ...Are you hungry?")
tr("Oh you don't count as a person. I was talking about customers! Unless... I don't suppose you're hungry?")
tr("Your pedantry is ever-helpful. I'm forever in debt to your priceless advice.")
tr("...With that said, we still need customers. I don't suppose you're hungry?")
tr("Not really...")
tr("... ...")
tr("Wow! That's a big cactus.")
tr("Don't change the subject!")
tr("That went pretty smoothly!")
tr("Mhm, it seems they've sort of got a handle on things around here. I suppose they could use a LITTLE extra help.")
tr("Not too much extra help but hmm...")
tr("How about you, Bart? You seem nonremarkable. Do you want to help out in the kitchen?")
tr("Hm. Kitchens, kitchens. ...Are there knives?")
tr("I don't like when knives are left sitting around. I'm always nervous I'll get Final Destinationed.")
tr("I mean... if Bart doesn't want to do it I'll do it! I can be unremarkable. Or I guess, \"NON-remarkable\"!")
tr("Nonremarkable? Oh you've already made quite a mark Alyssa.")
tr("There was that time you called us rude for leaving during a council meeting! Or just now when you highlighted my poor grammar.")
tr("Your... your poor grammar? Oh come on, that's unfair! I didn't mean anything by it, I just didn't realize you had such thin skin.")
tr("Mhm mhm. I'm rude, with poor grammar, and unfair, and thin skinned. Did I miss any?")
tr("Don't... Are you trying to memorize this? Please don't make a list!!!")
tr("Hey #player#! ...Just checking in on the business. Everything going alright?")
tr("It's great")
tr("It's so-so")
tr("It's a struggle")
tr("Everything's going great in the kitchen! There's only a few customers, though...")
tr("Hmm it's going fine, I guess! But there's only a few customers...")
tr("Oh, we're struggling a little bit. There's only a few customers...")
tr("Ah yes, it's just a steady trickle of customers. But at least it's better than no customers at all!")
tr("Hmm I see. So you'll probably be stuck with this 'steady trickle' thing for a while?")
tr("Oh it should pick up once word spreads! Any minute now.")
tr("Oh that's cool.")
tr("...")
tr("...")
tr("Sooooo how much longer is this gonna take? I have a date with a tennis player –")
tr("Well I can't do it if you're watching!")
tr("Hurry up! I'm still hungry!!!")
tr("You sure you're getting all this, Bart?")
tr("Yeah well, it seems simple. I mean cooking's just applied chemistry...")
tr("...And chemistry is just applied physics, which is just well, common sense.")
tr("The only hard part for me is recognizing which people are sitting where.")
tr("I should have been more open about this up front, but I think I might be mildly face blind.")
tr("You're not FACE BLIND, you just never LOOK at people!")
tr("Ha. An interesting segue... Is someone blind if they keep their eyes closed all the time?")
tr("Yes, definitely")
tr("Hmm, maybe")
tr("No, not really")
tr("No, not at all")
tr("Yeah, that makes sense! ...If they can't see, they're blind. If their eyes are closed, that still counts.")
tr("Hmm kind of. I mean their eyes still work, they're just not using them. I guess they're kind of blind.")
tr("Ohh they're not technically blind if their eyes still work. I don't think you can use that word.")
tr("No, they're definitely not blind! Blindness is a medical thing, you can't use the word that way.")
tr("You mean... If they just CHOOSE to keep their eyes closed? No they're not blind. They're just a MORON!")
tr("Haha. \"Moron\". Touche I guess. Well, let's just call my condition selective face blindness for now.")
tr("Anyway King Frungle Lumps III, your food is almost done.")
tr("I'm going to plate it, and then take it to that other person over there.")
tr("What!? They look nothing like me!! ...You really ARE face blind!")
tr("Nope, this one's for spite.")
tr("...")
tr("Oh hey Alyssa! How'd your date go with the tennis player?")
tr("Ohhhh you know how it goes. They're nice enough and all, but nobody wants to commit to commit, if that makes sense.")
tr("Ahh yes, that's the problem with tennis players. Love means nothing to them.")
tr("Anyway, I'm sort of surprised you ended up here of all places.")
tr("I thought you'd be way too popular for a dumpy place like this, #player#!")
tr("You mean this island?")
tr("You mean this restaurant?")
tr("You mean Fat Sensei?")
tr("A dumpy place like this? ...Are you talking about this island?")
tr("Well yeah I mean what's here? You've got four nerds in a big banana. A popular chef like you, well-")
tr("-I figured you'd be hitting bigger cities with wealthier clientele, things like that.")
tr("A popular chef like me? ...Wait since when am I popular? I'm honestly surprised you've even heard of me.")
tr("A dumpy place like this? ...Are you talking about this restaurant?")
tr("What!? No!")
tr("Wow Alyssa! Turbo Fat? Dumpy?? ...That's an incredibly brash statement.")
tr("Yeah, and since when am I popular? I'm honestly surprised you've even heard of me.")
tr("A dumpy place like this? ...Are you talking about Fat Sensei?")
tr("Why would I be talking about Fat Sensei!?")
tr("What!? ...I'm not a place! And I'm certainly not dumpy.")
tr("Yeah, they're not dumpy! ...And since when am I popular? I'm honestly surprised you've even heard of me!")
tr("Heard of you!? After the whole Desert Q thing you're actually pretty legendary in certain circles!")
tr("...You should get your name out there more. How do you feel about filming a cooking show? Just a few episodes! No pressure.")
tr("Yeah, let's do it")
tr("I'll think about it")
tr("No, I'm not interested")
tr("Sure, I'd love to do a cooking show! Well, when I'm here anyways.")
tr("When you're here? ...I mean... were you planning to be somewhere else?")
tr("Well we've got a bunch of other locations! But I'll set aside the time whenever we're nearby.")
tr("Hmm I'll think about it. It sounds like a lot of work...")
tr("Hmm no thanks, I'm already busy enough as is. I don't know where I'd find the time!")
tr("Hmph yeah, figured as much. Why commit to something when you can just float through life? You're just like that tennis player...")
tr("WHAT!? #player#, you should never let ANYBODY call you a tennis player!!! Stand up for yourself!")
tr("I... ...what!?")
tr("You're doing this cooking show. No matter what!!! That will show them who's a tennis player!")
tr("I... I am!?!?!")
tr("I... I was already planning to!?!?!")
tr("So how did Turbo Fat get so popular anyway? ...Was it anything we can imitate here?")
tr("Oh just the usual stuff, marketing, word of mouth... Patience...")
tr("Mmm, yes, marketing! King Frungle's been umm... reaching out to people! It's been going... alright.")
tr("Yes yes, we're OBVIOUSLY already doing that stuff! We're not stupid, you know.")
tr("Perhaps you could try some kind of a fun banana mascot? You obviously like bananas...")
tr("Ugh, I HATE bananas!")
tr("You're a banana")
tr("But they're everywhere")
tr("But you're sitting on one")
tr("But... but you're sitting on a banana!")
tr("Does this banana look COMFORTABLE to you!? Do you want to sit on my banana and tell me how comfortable it is!?!")
tr("It's rough, and it's coarse, and it gets everywhere!!")
tr("But... they're so pervasive here!")
tr("Oh of course! How could I hate them when they're everywhere?? I bet you're also a big fan of mosquitos and... and sand!")
tr("Well, I hate bananas!! They're rough, and they're coarse, and they get everywhere!!")
tr("But... YOU'RE a banana! ...You've been a banana this whole time!")
tr("What!? I'm not a banana!")
tr("Kendall, don't listen to #player#, they're calling me a banana! I think THEY'RE secretly a banana!!")
tr("Okay, that's enough. You're not a banana. Nobody's a banana. ... ...Bananas aren't real.")
tr("Was there anything else? What about your Poki Desert location, you were mentioning that earlier.")
tr("Ah-ha hahaha. Yes, the success of our Poki Desert location.")
tr("Well, that one was more a matter of falling rump-first into serendipitous circumstances.")
tr("Oh we haven't done THAT yet. ...Which body part did you mention?")
tr("So, I'm slightly confused by the name Kflab... After all, your names are Kendall and King Frumble Lumps III.")
tr("Yeah I was thinking that too. Shouldn't it be...")
tr("Kkab")
tr("Kkflab")
tr("Kkfliab")
tr("Kkfliiiab")
tr("Shouldn't it be Kkflab? For 'Kendall' and 'King Frungle Lumps'?")
tr("Shouldn't it be Kkfliab? For 'Kendall' and 'King Frungle Lumps Ihh'?")
tr("King Frungle Lumps 'IHH'? What the heck is 'Ihh'!?")
tr("III is a roman numeral, it means 'The Third'! You're saying it like it's a word...")
tr("It isn't!? I thought it was just three letter I's! 'Ihh!' I kind of like it that way better.")
tr("Shouldn't it be Kkfliiiab? For 'Kendall' and 'King Frungle Lumps III'?")
tr("Yeah! ...That's what I said!")
tr("Shouldn't it be Kkab? for 'Kendall' and 'King'?")
tr("#player#, 'King' is just an honorific. It's not technically a part of their name.")
tr("'King' is an honorific AND a part of my name!")
tr("Your... Your parents named you 'King'?")
tr("Yes! 'Frungle' is an honorific too. And 'Lumps' is even more honorific! And the 'III' is the cherry on the honor cake!")
tr("Come to think of it, you should be WAY more honored to say my name!")
tr("Ahh yes. I'm starting to fully appreciate your... onerousness.")
tr("Well, King Frungle Lumps III has such an... ample name! We decided to just use the 'Fl' from their name, and the 'K' from my name.")
tr("Anyways, King Frungle Lumps III has such an... ample name! We decided to just use the 'Fl' from their name, and the 'K' from my name.")
tr("The 'K' is from my name too!!!")
tr("Oh sure – well that's true! The 'K' is from both our names. We both share the 'K' part of 'Kflab'.")
tr("No! The 'K' is from my name, and NOT yours! Your 'K' isn't in the name.")
tr("It... Ohhhhh...")
tr("...")
tr("So these sugary globs have a little fruit and sugar, or sometimes cream cheese...")
tr("Ugh cream cheese! In desserts!?")
tr("I can't stand cream cheese, it tastes like armpits! ...And not in the cute way.")
tr("Should we cut?")
tr("What do you mean 'cut'? ...This isn't a 20th century sitcom where we're trying to skimp on film.")
tr("We just record everything and cut stuff out afterward!")
tr("I see...")
tr("If you'd like me to cut the cheese later, you can-")
tr("N-no! No thank you, that won't be necessary.")
tr("Anyway keep going, what other ingredients?")
tr("There's a cute way!?")
tr("You tell me if there's a cute way, you're the one using armpit cheese in your desserts!")
tr("Please tell me this part isn't going on the internet?")
tr("Don't worry about that, just keep going. What other ingredients?")
tr("Hey, I like cream cheese!")
tr("Okay, no thanks. I'm not going down THAT rabbit hole right now.")
tr("Just because I like cream cheese doesn't mean I like armpits!")
tr("I'm not here to judge! I'm just here to film, just keep going. What other ingredients?")
tr("Um yeah, a little butter, and sometimes this semisweet chocolate, for the...")
tr("Ugh, no way! I know that chocolate. You know what my friends call that brand? Dog vomit chocolate.")
tr("I can't belieeeeve such good food has such bad content! Eyeuucchh.")
tr("Is this your first time doing this?")
tr("Maybe this was a bad idea")
tr("Please don't insult our food")
tr("I take it this is your first time doing this sort of thing. ...Can you NOT talk about our food's bad content?")
tr("Maybe this was a bad idea! I didn't know you had such strong objections to our food's bad content...")
tr("Can you take it easy on the insults? I don't think our food has bad content...")
tr("Oh don't worry, this is all going great! ...I can see the arguments in the comment sections now, it'll make for good content.")
tr("Bad content is good content!?")
tr("King Frungle seems... difficult to get along with.")
tr("Ohhh hmm... how can I put this into words. Are you a cat person?")
tr("Yes")
tr("No")
tr("Don't you dare drag cats into this!")
tr("Well I'm a cat person, and I have a few cats at home.")
tr("And I have one cat in particular who scratches me every time I pet it. Every time!")
tr("But I love all my cats and I still pet that cat anyway, even if it scratches me.")
tr("Mmm... Maybe you shouldn't pet that cat.")
tr("What! That's the saddest thing I ever heard.")
tr("Is that how you live your life? Not petting cats because they might scratch you?")
tr("...What will you do when you run out of things to pet!?")
tr("Oh, Fat Sensei! We just finished up our daily council meeting.")
tr("Ah yes! Nice to see you again, Kendall. ...Alyssa. ...Bart. ...And, umm... really weird named person.")
tr("...WEIRD NAMED PERSON??")
tr("???")
tr("It started with an F didn't it? I think it was...")
tr("Frumble Lunks")
tr("Flumble Lonks")
tr("Frungle Lumps")
tr("Flumgle Lomps")
tr("Flabbo")
tr("I think it was Frumble Lunks?")
tr("I think it was Flabbo?")
tr("I think it was Flumble Lonks?")
tr("I think it was Frungle Lumps?")
tr("I think it was Flumgle Lomps?")
tr("My name is King Frungle Lumps III!")
tr("And you're just pretending to forget it!! ...You're probably just jealous it's so much bigger than yours!!!")
tr("What King Frungle Lumps III means is umm, it's nice to see you too!")
tr("No they don't.")
tr("No I don't! And stop doing that, I HATE when you translate for me.")
tr("How am I supposed to hurt people's feelings when you keep cushioning my insults!")
tr("Ohh ha ha! They umm... they mean well.")
tr("Nope, no they don't.")
tr("They're ummm... an acquired taste?")
tr("Aaand that's strike three. Trust me I've known them forever? Same icky taste.")
tr("Haw haw, three strikes! Serves you right for sticking up for me, Kendall. Go ahead and take your stupid base.")
tr("I don't think that's how baseball works...")
tr("So Fat Senseiiiii! ...Did you want to share with Alyssa that one idea we brainstormed?")
tr("You remember, that one ummm... serendipitous rump idea?")
tr("Kendall what's wrong with you!?")
tr("Fat Sensei what's wrong with you!?")
tr("I remember that idea!")
tr("Oh yeah! The serendipitous rump idea. I remember that one!")
tr("No you don't!!! ...What serendipitous rump idea!?")
tr("Kendall, what's wrong with you!?")
tr("That's what I remember! Something about serendipity? ...And rumps?")
tr("Fat Sensei, what's wrong with you!?")
tr("That's not what I said!!! ...What serendipitous rump idea!?")
tr("Kendall, are you talking about our 'serendipitous circumstances' in Poki Desert?")
tr("That was tongue in cheek. ...Serendipitous circumstances is a long-winded way of saying we got lucky.")
tr("Sure - something like that would be great! But I don't think we can count on it.")
tr("Ah yes, thank you!! ...See? That's sound advice from the person who thinks I'm rude, poorly grammared, and thin skinned.")
tr("Ah yes, thank you!! ...See? That's sound advice from the person who thinks I'm rude, dumpy, poorly grammared, and thin skinned.")
tr("Wh-what!? Is it something I said!?")
tr("Sorry, what was that? I couldn't understand your perfect grammar through your remarkably fat skin.")
tr("What did I do to you...")
tr("So before we start shooting today, I wanted to show you something. Look at all these views you're getting!")
tr("Wow! It's really taking off.")
tr("Yeah! And look, your most popular episode was this one, where you had a big eye booger the whole time.")
tr("Big eye booger!?")
tr("That's embarrassing")
tr("That's amazing")
tr("That's the internet")
tr("That's disgusting")
tr("That's really weird")
tr("That's kind of embarrassing, actually...")
tr("That's kind of amazing, actually...")
tr("That's the internet for you...")
tr("That's kind of disgusting, actually...")
tr("That's umm... really weird.")
tr("Yeah, people in the comment section named her Bella!")
tr("I made an entire followup episode about her with nothing but close-ups of the booger.")
tr("Hah hah, you should see it! Hold on, I'll show you.")
tr("I don't want to see that!!!")
tr("Hah hah! So I was thinking about a followup episode, maybe if, hmmm... Hey come here, can I see something real quick?")
tr("I'm going to go wash my face...")
tr("Oh no! Bella!!!")
tr("So... How was your food? It looks like you enjoyed it~")
tr("Don't tell me what I enjoyed! The food was terrible. Everything is terrible!!! You're both terrible!")
tr("...")
tr("...I have some advice for you, King Frungle Lumps III. You're not going to like it, but it's important that you hear it from me first.")
tr("Hmph, well fine. Give me your stupid advice.")
tr("You see, King Frungle, the thing is, how do I put this...")
tr("The word 'Boob' looks like boobs in three different ways.")
tr("The upper case 'B' looks like boobs from above. The middle 'oo' looks like boobs from the front. And the last 'b' looks like boobs from the side.")
tr("...!?")
tr("WHAT!? You're right, I didn't like that advice at ALL! Get out of here, you filthy jagoon!!!")
tr("Umm. Okay. I have some ACTUAL advice.")
tr("It's no fun being alone")
tr("WHERE do I BEGIN!")
tr("Be nicer to people")
tr("Your life will improve when you learn how to treat people better.")
tr("It hurts when nobody wants you around, doesn't it?")
tr("But if people treated you the way you treat them, you wouldn't want them around either.")
tr("I can't stand you. You're selfish, you complain and insult people all the time-")
tr("You're even rude to Kendall, the only friend you actually have! But they're kind of everyone's friend, so maybe they don't count-")
tr("Also you're an annoying customer, and umm your handwriting sucks and... did I miss anything?")
tr("Ahh... I think that covers it.")
tr("Oh yeah and what the heck is with your stupid name!? Your drivers license must be like a mile long.")
tr("...You filthy jagoon.")
tr("F-filthy jagoon!? Th-that was uncalled for! Oww! ...Owwwwww!!!")
tr("Wait just a minute... Is THAT what I've been doing to people?")
tr("...Wow! ... ...I suck.")
tr("Wow, this food is one-of-a-kind!")
tr("Thanks, I practiced so much!")
tr("Oh, anybody could do it...")
tr("Thanks, it's Sensei's recipes!")
tr("Thanks, it's all because of Fat Sensei's recipes!")
tr("Thanks, I've put in a lot of practice!")
tr("Oh, it's really nothing special... Anybody could do it!")
tr("I'm being serious. These cakes are so soft and fluffy and cutting into them it's... it's like cutting into a kitten.")
tr("Ew. I mean... thank you. I think.")
tr("So you're really King Frungle Lumps III's dad?")
tr("Mmm, I can see the resemblance. But your name... What happened to King Frungle Lumps II?")
tr("King Frungle Lumps II? Ha ha ha. No, no, there's a reason behind that silly name. Their mom wanted to name them Dillon!")
tr("But I thought, \"King Frungle Lumps III\", here's a name that'll toughen them up a little you know.")
tr("If you can survive grade school with a name like that, you'll go on to do great things! It was just something I wanted to try.")
tr("How did that work out?")
tr("What a fun experiment!")
tr("Congrats, you raised a jerk")
tr("Do you regret it?")
tr("Well, do you... regret putting them through that?")
tr("Mmmm well, you know. They're wealthy and powerful, buuuut I don't think they have many friends.")
tr("Well, they're a total jerk now so... I mean, good job I guess.")
tr("Ahhaha! Thank you. You're right, they're wealthy and powerful buuuut I don't think they have many friends.")
tr("How did that work out?")
tr("Mmmm well, you know. They're wealthy and powerful, buuuut I don't think they have many friends.")
tr("Wow, what a fun experiment!")
tr("Ahhaha! Thank you. As far as whether it worked, ahh...")
tr("...They're wealthy and powerful, buuuut I don't think they have many friends.")
tr("Ehh!? That seems great! I have friends out the ass, but what does that get you in life? I'll take wealth and power any day.")
tr("Hmm. Maybe I should change my name...")
tr("King Frungle... and Bart! Ahh hello! I didn't realize you'd brought a friend.")
tr("So Bart, how are things from this side of the kitchen? Ahha ha ha~")
tr("Oh you don't need to address me directly, I'm just here as a token indicator of King Frungle's personal growth.")
tr("Wow, personal growth! Good for you, King Frungle~")
tr("It IS good for me! I can't thank you enough, your advice was exactly what I needed to hear.")
tr("Sorry I called you a filthy jagoon")
tr("I'm usually so bad at advice")
tr("You don't have to thank me")
tr("Advice? It was meant as an insult")
tr("I'm sorry for calling you a filthy jagoon... But I'm glad you're doing better!")
tr("That's great, I'm usually so bad at giving advice!")
tr("I was just saying what everyone else was thinking! You don't need to thank me for it.")
tr("Exactly what you needed to hear!? ...I wasn't trying to help, I was trying to draw blood.")
tr("... ...")
tr("Anyway you were right, the word 'Boob' DOES look like boobs three different ways. It really got me thinking.")
tr("...Wait, what!?")
tr("We can control our actions, but we can't control how others around us perceive those actions. You know?")
tr("All those times I thought I was being playful and fun, others were just seeing a boob three different ways.")
tr("I'm going to concentrate more during social situations about how my actions affect other people-")
tr("Then maybe they'll see me as King Frungle three different ways! Until then I'll apologize for acting like a boob~")
tr("I'm so sorry, Bart!")
tr("Hey no worries. It's like water off a token friend's back, ha ha.")
tr("YOUR advice? YOUR advice helped him?")
tr("Hey, that profound nugget of wisdom has gotten me through some tough times.")
tr("...You know #player#, I have some advice for you. The word 'boy' looks like a boy wearing glasses...")
tr("That's not helpful!")
tr("So we're already leaving, even though our restaurant in Kflab is struggling?")
tr("Ahh they'll get by on the few customers they have. It'll be tough for them but...")
tr("For now, we should focus our attention on other locations that are doing even worse!")
tr("Ooh, Sounds fun!")
tr("Oh. Sounds fun...")
tr("Do we have to?")
tr("Wow, things really turned around for Cannoli Sandbar!")
tr("Yes, they'll have no problems with all those new customers they have! It should be smooth sailing for a while.")
tr("For now, we should focus our attention on other locations that are doing much, much worse.")
tr("Ooh, Sounds fun!")
tr("Oh. Sounds fun...")
tr("Do we have to?")
tr("Ooh! Sounds fun, where are we going next?")
tr("Mmm yes, I forget! Was this next one the stinky swamp... or the active volcano?")
tr("Oh. Sounds fun...")
tr("Yes, now off to our next restaurant! I forget, was this one the stinky swamp... or the active volcano?")
tr("I mean... Do we have to?")
tr("Yes yes, off to our next restaurant! I forget, was this one the stinky swamp... or the active volcano?")
tr("... ...")
tr("I'm tossing you in that volcano")
tr("I'm knocking you into the mud")
tr("That's a joke, right?")
tr("When we get to that volcano, I'm tossing you in.")
tr("When we get to that stinky swamp, I'm knocking you into the mud.")
tr("I'm just going to pretend that's a joke. ...It's a joke, right?")
tr("Ah-ha hahahaha~")
tr("Following Kendall's suggestion, the three remaining council members renamed 'Kflab' to 'Cannoli Sandbar'.")
tr("A flood of tourists overwhelmed their airports, in addition to a few health-conscious visitors who arrived to the island on foot, in a completely sensible manner.")
tr("Wow, tourism skyrocketed after we handled the problem with Cannoli Sandbar's incredibly dumb name!")
tr("Yes, this should really help the prospects for...")
tr("(sigh) ...the \"Turbo Fat\" franchise....")
tr("I already apologized for \"Turbo Fat\"")
tr("\"Turbo Fat\" is a great name")
tr("\"Turbo Fat\" is your fault")
tr("\"Turbo Fat\" is Tunathy's fault")
tr("Don't sigh at me! Turbo Fat is a great name!!!")
tr("I'll sigh all I want! If Cannoli Sandbar put you in charge, you'd probably call it...")
tr("...'Slovenly Chubsters' or something like that.")
tr("Hey, I already apologized for the whole \"Turbo Fat\" mistake!")
tr("Hmph, if Cannoli Sandbar put you in charge, you'd probably call it... 'Slovenly Chubsters' or something like that.")
tr("Hey, that name is your fault!")
tr("Hmph, if Cannoli Sandbar put you in charge, you'd probably call it... 'Slovenly Chubsters' or something like that.")
tr("Hey, that name is Tunathy's fault!")
tr("Hmph, if Cannoli Sandbar put you in charge, you'd probably call it... 'Slovenly Chubsters' or something like that.")
tr("I feel a little bad for King Frungle though.")
tr("Yes, well there's no point in feeling sad about things like that.")
tr("It's human nature to look back on things like that and wonder how things could have gone differently.")
tr("But the past is in the past, nothing can be done.")
tr("We could cheer them up")
tr("There's nothing we can do")
tr("Oh it's only King Frungle...")
tr("We could always visit King Frungle and cheer them up!")
tr("Ahh, I'm afraid it's simply out of our hands.")
tr("...")
tr("Well... I suppose it's TECHNICALLY possible.")
tr("... ...Do we have to???")
tr("You're right, there's nothing we can possibly do...")
tr("...We definitely can't like... visit them and cheer them up. I can't even imagine! (judgy head tilt)")
tr("There's just no way! ...Right? It's beyond our reach.")
tr("... (judgy head tilt)")
tr("... ... (judgy head tilt)")
tr("... ...Please don't make me go!")
tr("I mean it's only King Frungle!")
tr("If it were anyone else, maybe we'd have to like... visit them and cheer them up.")
tr("Mmm... I suppose, technically.")
tr("... ...I really don't want to do that though!")
tr("So hmm... IF we were to change the name...")
tr("Yes, that's a great idea! We can change it to something like... Frungleton! Or Frungle Lump Isle.")
tr("Mmmm well, it's unfair to name it after just one of the four council members...")
tr("THREE council members.")
tr("Three?")
tr("Yyyyyyep. Three actual council members and a self-proclaimed \"king\".")
tr("Self-proclaimed!? Well, why don't we just name it after...")
tr("You four, but different")
tr("You three")
tr("Us two")
tr("Fat Sensei")
tr("Name it after you four... but just in a punchier way!")
tr("Or I was thinking, if w-")
tr("I like #player.possessive# idea! How about a name like... Frungle and Friends? King Frungle and the Lumps!")
tr("...'King Frungle And The Lumps'? We're naming an island. Not a pop music act from the ancient 20th century.")
tr("King Frungle And The Lumps")
tr("Name it after you three... If we remove King Frungle's letters from the name, that leaves us with what. K-A-B? Hmm...")
tr("Name it after the two of us... Fat Sensei and #player#!")
tr("...What?")
tr("#player#-Fat Isle! Or... Fat-#player#-sei-burg!")
tr("#player#, you already stuck us with the name 'Turbo Fat'. Please stop making up names. You're terrible at it.")
tr("But it's so fun...")
tr("Name it after Fat Sensei! I have the perfect name too!")
tr("...The perfect name?")
tr("Yes please, enlighten us. What do YOU want to call it?")
tr("Fatten Island")
tr("Fatsmania")
tr("Fatagascar")
tr("The Isle Of Fats")
tr("We'll call it Fatten Island! You know?")
tr("Fatten Island")
tr("We'll call it Fatagascar! You know?")
tr("Fatagascar")
tr("We'll call it The Isle Of Fats! You know?")
tr("The Isle Of Fats")
tr("We'll call it Fatsmania! You know?")
tr("Fatsmania")
tr("(cough) ...Are you quite done?")
tr("Yeah, sure.")
tr("So anyways... I was thinking if we remove King Frungle's letters from the name, that leaves us with what. K-A-B? Hmm...")
tr("Kendall, Alyssa and Bart...")
tr("Kend-all-al-liss-sa-an-bart... Ken-uh-lee-sa-and-bart...")
tr("...Cannoli Sandbar?")
tr("Cannoli Sandbar? Oh that's much better!")
tr("What? No! What about... Cannoli Sandblumps? Or Canfrungle Alyssabar?")
tr("Hm. Everything works out if we just take out King Frungle's name. Thoughts?")
tr("THOUGHTS!?! I have a few THOUGHTS!!! Is a string of profanities a THOUGHT!?")
tr("I like Cannoli Sandbar")
tr("I still like #bad_island_name#")
tr("I like Cannoli Sandblumps")
tr("I still like my other name")
tr("I like Canfrungle Alyssabar")
tr("Ooh, I like the sound of Cannoli Sandbar! Let's call it that.")
tr("Fair enough, Let's vote.")
tr("I still like #bad_island_name#! C'mon who's with me? #bad_island_name#!!! Let's call it that.")
tr("How about this, let's take a vote.")
tr("Actually, I like the sound of Cannoli Sandblumps! Let's call it that.")
tr("Fair enough, Let's vote.")
tr("I still like that other name I came up with...")
tr("Fair enough, Let's vote.")
tr("Actually, I like the sound of Canfrungle Alyssabar! Let's call it that.")
tr("How about this, let's take a vote.")
tr("All in favor of Cannoli Sandbar?")
tr("...")
tr("Oooh sorry, that's five against one...")
tr("You're all so mean!")
tr("Ooh. five against zero. Hey cool, haha. Two birds with one stone.")
tr("...")
tr("Oooh sorry, that's four against two...")
tr("You're all so mean!")
tr("Ooh. Four against one. Hey cool, haha. Two birds with one stone.")
tr("So, you're not quite the hot tourist spot you want to be huh?")
tr("Well sadly - tourism has been pretty close to zero since we founded this island a few years ago!")
tr("But the four of us are looking at our options for improving things. We're open to any ideas you have of course!")
tr("Well, first of all... \"Kflab\" is a very... unconventional name. Does it mean anything?")
tr("It's the first letter of our names. Kendall, King Frungle Lumps III, Alyssa and Bart. K-F-L-A-B.")
tr("You see we all – well, some of us had different ideas for the island's name. So this was the compromise we agreed upon.")
tr("Hm. Hm. I see. Well... ...At least your island's stupid name acts as a helpful mnemonic so I can remember your less-stupid names.")
tr("Um! Well...")
tr("Your names are fine!")
tr("Frungle, your name is dumb")
tr("Kendall, your name is pretty")
tr("Bart, your name is normal")
tr("Bart, your name is perfectly normal. It's just these other names are a little out there!")
tr("Anyway it's nice to meet all of you umm... Shoot let's see, was it...")
tr("Kringle...?")
tr("Alopecia...?")
tr("...And... Kung Fu Hustle 3?")
tr("That... that wasn't even particularly close.")
tr("...Sorry! I'm probably just groggy from our long flight.")
tr("Kendall, your name is pretty! It makes me think of Kringles, or gumballs!")
tr("...Gwuh? Gumballs!?")
tr("Umm, sorry! I'm probably just hungry from our long flight.")
tr("King Frungle Lumps, your name is the only dumb one! I don't know why Fat Sensei... \"lumped\" you all together.")
tr("THE ONLY DUMB ONE!? Your name's dumber than MY name!")
tr("What is a \"#player#\" anyways? Some kind of fig!?")
tr("...Ahh, sorry don't mind us. We're probably just grumpy because of our long flight.")
tr("You mean our long run.")
tr("Yes... Long flight, long run, whatever...")
tr("All your names are just fine! Fat Sensei's not usually THIS bad with first impressions.")
tr("...Maybe they're just grumpy because of our long flight.")
tr("You mean our long run.")
tr("Yes... Long flight, long run, whatever...")
tr("Ohhh #player#! Welcome to our island, we're happy to have you. How was your flight?")
tr("We didn't fly! We just ehhh, ran here... ...")
tr("... ...You ran? That's an odd choice for an island destination. You must have had to run... VERY far.")
tr("Yes yes well, we needed the exercise. Have to keep up my girlish figure, you know~")
tr("Although I must say, there's a remarkable lack of tourists on the Kflab Islands?")
tr("Mmm technically not \"The Kflab Islands\". It's just \"Kflab\".")
tr("\"Kflab\"... How is that pronounced?")
tr("It's pronounced... exactly how I just pronounced it. What kind of question is that??")
tr("It's the kind of question that only makes sense if you were reading my words on a screen. Unless. Oh. Okay. I see.")
tr("Ahh anyway... If you'll excuse us, we have some cooking to take care of.")
tr("In the middle of our council meeting!? I mean, that's kind of rude.")
tr("Ah, sorry yes! Force of habit. We'll be right back~")
tr("Following the immense popularity of Turbo Fat's Poki Desert location, word spread and the pair opened more and more locations.")
tr("With their budgetary constraints, they still had to selectively open in less popular locations.")
tr("So where did you say our next restaurant was opening? A stinky swamp? An active volcano?")
tr("Hmph, I don't appreciate your candor. And it's unwarranted, because our next location is a tropical island paradise~")
tr("Oh that's right, the \"Kflab Islands\". NOW I remember.")
tr("Ahh beach life! Crowded shorelines, sand in your sneakers... Partying so hard it permanently increases your risk of melanoma!")
tr("Riiight, I'm sure I'll have a blast. Partying in K-Flab. FLAB!!!")
tr("You're focusing too much on the flab part! And not enough on the cool island part.")
tr("Both parts are important")
tr("The flab part is important too")
tr("The island part is important too")
tr("You're making beach life sound awful")
tr("I think I'm focusing the correct amount on each part.")
tr("This from the person who named our restaurant \"Turbo Fat\"! Hmph, you're suddenly so picky about names.")
tr("\"Fat\" is cute! \"Flab\" is weird...")
tr("The flab part is a major factor!")
tr("This from the person who named our restaurant \"Turbo Fat\"! Hmph, you're suddenly so picky about names.")
tr("\"Fat\" is cute! \"Flab\" is weird...")
tr("The island part is a major factor! Crowded shorelines? Sand in my sneakers?")
tr("Ahh yes, that sneaky sneaker sand! You can never quite get rid of all of it, it's like a fun little souvenir~")
tr("...I'm starting to understand why the name \"Kflab\" doesn't bother you very much.")
tr("And besides, crowded shorelines? Sand in my sneakers? You're not making beach life sound very appealing.")
tr("Ahh yes, that sneaky sneaker sand! You can never quite get rid of all of it, it's like a fun little souvenir~")
tr("...I'm starting to understand why the name \"Kflab\" doesn't bother you very much.")
tr("Okay yes, yes fine. I admit, the name \"Kflab\" is incredibly off-putting.")
tr("I'm sure there's a profound meaning or... something. There just has to be.")
