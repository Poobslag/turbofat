narrator, n

n: As Turbo Fat grew more and more popular, they were finally able to branch out into more competitive venues.
n: Their Chocolava Canyon location was their most successful location, always bustling with customers.\n\nBut, they struggled to stand out among other prestigious restaurants nearby.
s1: /._. Mmm? Did something catch your eye?
p1: ._./ Look at this! This CarbCraft restaurant apparently won "Zagma Chef Of The Year" too.
p1: ...I've seen this same plaque at every restaurant here! What the heck is a Zagma Chef of the Year?
 (p1 faces left)
s1: ^y^ Oh, you haven't heard of Zagma? Because I know everything about Zagma.
p1: /._. ...Really?
s1: -o- Go on, ask me about Zagma.
p1: ._./ I just don't want our customers thinking that somehow we're bad chefs because we don't have a silly plaque.
 (p1 faces right)
s1: ._. Mmm... Well.
 (p1 faces left)
s1: <_< Getting one of those plaques isn't easy. It will require a considerable investment. But, I can point you in the right direction.
[you_do_it] Can't you win it for me?
[investment] A considerable investment?
[point_me] The right direction?
[i_can_do_it] I can do it myself!

[you_do_it]
p1: ._.; Can't you just win 'Chef Of The Year' yourself instead? You're already a great chef!
s1: No no. I have a conflict of interest, it's best if you do it yourself.
 (s1 faces left)
p1: -_- Conflict of interest hmm? I think you're just lazy.
s1: .__.; H-hey! Being lazy is a conflict too...
 (s1 faces right)

[investment]
p1: /._. A considerable investment? I've been practicing every day for weeks now!! What kind of investment do you mean?
s1: ^_^ Ohhh, about Â¥3,000 should cover it. Cash is fine~
p1: ^O^ Ha ha, nice try...
s1: ...

[point_me]
p1: ^__^/ Point me in the right direction? ...Because I figured I'd blindly head east again.
 (p1 faces right)
s1: -__- "Blindly head east again!?" Hmph don't be so naive. You can't go wandering in a random direction and expect to find anything.
s1: ._./ ...But... ...Yes, east is fine.
p1: ^o^ Lucky guess~
 (p1 faces left)

[i_can_do_it]
p1: ^O^ Oh I don't need your help! I'll just blindly head east again.
s1: -__- "Blindly head east again!?" Hmph don't be so naive. You can't go wandering in a random direction and expect to find anything.
s1: ._./ ...But... ...Yes, east is fine.
