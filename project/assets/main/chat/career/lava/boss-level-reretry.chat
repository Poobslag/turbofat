s1: Well this is it, you've used up all your other... ONE chances.
s1: >__< This is your TRUE last chance!
[only_one_chance] What happens if I mess up?
[wait_really] You seem serious this time
[still_doing_this] We're still doing this?

[only_one_chance]
p1: ._.; Only one chance!? ...What happens if I mess up?

[you_can_cheat]
s1: ._. Also, you can turn on cheats if you want to, over in the Settings menu.
[is_that_cheating] Isn't that cheating?
[will_it_count] Will it really count?

[is_that_cheating]
p1: /._. Turn on cheats? Isn't that cheating?
s1: Yes, cheating is cheating. But that's okay, everybody cheats.
c: <_< I don't remember agreeing to this, that they could cheat!
[shh]

[im_so_close]
p1: ^_^ I want to do it without cheating! I'm so close!
s1: ^n^ Mmm that's very honorable of you. But sometimes, it's honorable to know when to cheat, and to know when to not cheat.
c: <_< I don't remember agreeing to this, this kind of 'honorable cheat'!
[shh]

[will_it_count]
p1: ._.; Oh,I don't know... Will it really count if I cheat?
s1: Yes, don't worry, it still counts. Everybody cheats a little sometimes.
c: <_< I don't remember agreeing to this, that they could cheat!
