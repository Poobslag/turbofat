s1: Hmm, another restaurant this close!? I wonder if this is a part of the problem.
r: ^O^ What, this place? All they serve is that weird macrobiotic vegan stuff. You don't gotta worry about them.
p1: /._. We... don't?
r: I mean, I'm just thinking long term here.
r: Bottom line is when people gotta pick between healthy food and garbage food, the garbage food always wins.
r: <__< Y'know I mean. ...No offense.
 (sensei mood >__<)
d: ^_^/ Hello, can I um... Oh! ...Wait I've seen you around. You just opened that new "Turbo Fat" gym a few doors down, right?
 (diota enters)
 (player faces right)
r: /._. Yeah it's, actually it's a restaurant!
d: /._. Turbo Fat... restaurant? ... ... ...Did you name it that on purpose?
s1: >_< Well it's a better name than "Butt Up Cafe".
 (richie mood ^o^)
d: -__- Augh I KNOW! It's obviously "Buttercup Cafe" but... this crystal weed is out of control.
d: It springs up everywhere, we're calling a landscaping company to come clear it up.
s1: ^_^ Ahh, haha. Well. Best of luck.
d: /._. Yeah! So um, anyways nice meeting you, and just let us know if you ever need any, um...
p1: /._. ???
d: <_< Sorry! This is awkward but, I realized mid-sentence that I didn't want to... help you.
d: Like, that makes sense, right? I'm not being selfish?
[rude] Wow! Rude
[umm] ...
[okay] That makes sense
[fine] We won't help you either

[umm]
p1: <_< ...
d: Sorry. Bye!
 (diota exits)

[okay]
p1: ^y^ Yeah, that makes sense.
d: Sorry. Bye!
 (diota exits)

[fine]
p1: >_< So that's how it is? ...Fine, we don't want to help you either.
d: Sorry. Bye!
 (diota exits)

[rude]
p1: ._.; Wow! ...That's a little rude...
d: Sorry. Bye!
