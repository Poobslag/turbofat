p1: Well! I guess this is our last day here.
r: Yeah! Thanks for all your help. We're putting out better food now, and business is starting to pick up a little.
r: ^_^/ Check it out! Three customers!
p1: ^o^ Yeah! Ha ha.
s1: /._. I wish we could figure out why the customers are leaving so fast. There's definitely something.
s1: I checked your recipes and you're using all the same ingredients, but something's just... different here.
p1: /._. Something IS different here! But not in a bad way. Even without the customers I just feel... ...nice, you know?
p1: ^__^ Maybe it's just being around you guys! I don't really want to leave.
s1: Well! There's nothing saying we can't help out for another week.
s1: ^_^ Let's step up our game and win over a few more customers. What do you say, Bones?
b: ^_^ Bork! Leave it to me!
