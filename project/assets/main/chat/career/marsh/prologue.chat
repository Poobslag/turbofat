n: At the Merrymellow Marsh Turbo Fat location, business was once again unusually slow. This situation was starting to feel familiar...
n: ...However unlike the other Turbo Fat locations, there were plenty of people around!\n\nIt just seemed like none of them were very hungry.
p1: /._. So we're supposed to get more customers to show up? Like, with advertising or specials or something?
p1: .__.; ...Fat Sensei, I don't know anything about that stuff!

s1: ^y^ Oh don't worry, it's probably just something simple they messed up.
s1: Maybe they're not following our recipes, or they're treating their customers poorly.

[skunk_cemetery] ...Or there's a skunk cemetery?
[cooking_bad_on_purpose] ...Or they're faking it?
[hate_sweets] ...Or they hate sweets?

[skunk_cemetery]
p1: ^_^ Or maybe they built the restaurant on a desecrated skunk burial ground!
p1: An unscrupulous realtor sold them the property sight unseen! And... smell unsmelt!
s1: -_- Umm... it's probably not that.
p1: ^o^ Once we get there, you smell around for skunks! And I'll look for ghosts.

[cooking_bad_on_purpose]
p1: ^_^ Or maybe they're cooking poorly on purpose.
p1: Oh, they're ruining their food for the insurance money! Frightening away customers so they can walk away millionaires.
s1: -_- Umm... it's probably not that.
p1: ^o^ And they'd have gotten away with it if not for us meddling kids!

[hate_sweets]
p1: ^_^ Or maybe all the townspeople there hate sweets.
p1: Oh! Maybe they're fructose intolerant! The merest thought of sugar makes their stomach turn and ruins their poos.
s1: -_- Umm... it's probably not that.
p1: ^o^ I'll design a new healthy menu! Instead of fudge brownies and cheesecake... Pita wedges! And barley bites!

s1: -__- You know what, I think I'll take the lead on this one.
p1: /._. What? ...Why?
