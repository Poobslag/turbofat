[who_drives_me_crazy]
p1: /._. Is who driving me crazy? I've met a bunch of new people here.
s: Oh. Really? No one comes to mind, huh? Well that's nice.

s: I dunno if it's flirting, it's just -- the more you treat them like a human being, the less they treat you like one.
s: >_< Every conversation feels like a contest. They squeeze in these awkward compliments whenever they talk to you.
s: And they stop farting around you.... And they're always watching you to see what you laugh at, so they can laugh too.
s: -__- It's just... (sigh) Whatever. It could be worse.
[ill_fart] I'll fart around you
[thats_horrible] That's horrible
[awkward_compliment] You're so smart
[ive_been_there] I've been there
[hmm] Hmm

s: ^o^ Ha ha. Thanks. I think.

[thats_horrible]
p1: u_u Ugh, that sounds horrible.
s: Ahh it's not so bad, just gotta keep those shields up. I'm sure you know the drill.

[ive_been_there]
p1: >_< Yeah... I've been there before.
s: Ahh it's not so bad, just gotta keep those shields up. I'm sure you know the drill.

[hmm]
p1: /._. Hmm...
s: Well anyway, it's not so bad. Just gotta keep those shields up. I'm sure you know the drill.
