p1: /._. Any news?
d: u_u So yeah, I mean... We're trying a few promotions to get people back, but I don't know.
d: I HATE marketing, and I always sort of hoped word of mouth would be enough for a place like this?
d: @_@ And I mean for a while things were going great! ... ...I don't really get what changed....
p1: Well, maybe people don't like the new name. ...Have you thought about changing it again?
d: /._. ....Wait, what?
[butt_up_cafe] ^o^ Switch it back to Butt Up Cafe!
[butt_cafe] ^O^ Shorten it to Butt Cafe!
[nevermind] Oh, nevermind

[butt_up_cafe]
p1: ^o^ You know, maybe people miss the old Butt Up cafe!
 (s1 mood ^O^)
d: ...
d: <__< S-sorry. What? I can't tell if that's a joke or if you're actually making a dig at me.
d: I'm not really in the right headspace to parse that right now.
p1: Ha ha. You'll figure it out.

[butt_cafe]
p1: ^o^ Maybe just call it The Butt Cafe this time! You know, shorter! Punchier!
 (s1 mood ^O^)
d: ...
d: <__< S-sorry. What? I can't tell if that's a joke or if you're actually making a dig at me.
d: I'm not really in the right headspace to parse that right now.
p1: Ha ha. You'll figure it out.

[nevermind]
p1: <__< Oh... nevermind.
p1: I had an inappropriate joke, but somehow inappropriate jokes seem inappropriate right now.
d: u_u Heh, thanks. ...Hey, keep in touch, okay?
