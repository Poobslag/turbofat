s1: <_< Well... I'm sorry we still couldn't figure out what's wrong with the food here.
r: ^_^/ Hey, it ain't your fault! Maybe things are just different here for some reason.
p1: ^__^ Something IS different here! But not in a bad way. I don't really want to leave.
s1: /._. Well! There's nothing saying we can't stay another month.
b: OwO... Yeah. Stay forever!
s: OwO... You can just move here!
p1: ^o^ Yeah! Another month sounds great.
s1: ^N^ Wait... No. No, I'm sorry. Can we talk in private for a moment?
r: <_< Ehh yeah! Yeah sure. C'mon guys, lets's take five.

s1: u_u ...#player#, we can't do this to ourselves. They can do this to themselves, but we can't.
p1: /._. ...?
s1: Don't you see? We have an entire franchise to run.
s1: It was fun running just one restaurant. A small problem with small solutions.
s1: ^N^ And those problems are comfortable because we've solved them before. But that's not the life we chose.
s1: Once our business grew beyond two or three restaurants... Well, sometimes we have to trust other people to solve the fun problems.
p1: ...
s1: -_- We have to stop visiting Merrymellow Marsh.

s1: >_< -I know you don't want to! I don't want to either.
s1: ^y^ But, we have to find new challenges. It'll be better for us in the long run.
p1: Okay...
