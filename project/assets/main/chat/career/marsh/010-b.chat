s: Oh hey what's up. I heard you guys came the other day when I wasn't here. So did I miss like anything... important?
s1: Ahh, nothing important. We're still trying to figure out why this location isn't attracting more customers.
p1: ^_^ Yeah, Skins and Bones showed us their cooking skills. ...They seem nice!
s: <__< Hah. Yeah they DO seem nice.
p1: /._. Yeah! ...Umm, wait what? ...I feel like there's something you're not telling me.
s: -_- Hah hah. Yeah that's alright, you'll figure it out.
p1: <_< Umm... Alright. Sounds fun. Anywaaay...
p1: Why don't you show us your skills in the kitchen! Let's focus on some combos today, if you know about those.
s: ^_^ Yeah yeah! Combos. Sure thing.
