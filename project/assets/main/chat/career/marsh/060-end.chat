p1: ^_^/ Well... I guess we're out of here! It was nice meeting all of you.
s1: ^__^ Congratulations on the restaurant's success! All your hard work really paid off.
r: ^O^ Us? Heh what are you talking about! You two did all the work.
p1: <_< Wait, you didn't do anything? ...We didn't do anything either! Did we?
 (sensei mood /._.)
b: Well, you and #sensei# got all these customers to come!
p1: /._. Maybe? I talked to two or three of them at most! ...Were they all friends?
k: ^y^ You trained us to cook better! I bet that made a difference too.
[training_good] You improved a lot
[training_same] You didn't improve
[training_bad] You got worse

[training_good]
p1: ^_^ Yeah! Your cooking's gotten way better. That goes for all of you! I bet that's it.
 (skins mood ^__^, bones mood ^y^)

p1: ._.; I tried to train you but there's only so much I could teach you in such a short time!
p1: ^N^ Sorry Skins, I think it was probably something else...
 (skins mood ._.;)

[training_bad]
p1: -_- Skins, somehow your cooking actually got worse after our training. Now that you mention it,
p1: /._. Something brought in even more customers to make up for the ones you drove away.
 (skins mood .__.;)
k: u_u Mowwr...

h: /._. I heard the Buttercup Cafe shut down. ...Maybe we just got their leftovers?
[buttercup_happy] That's great!
[buttercup_ok] That's interesting
[buttercup_sad] That's too bad

[buttercup_happy]
p1: ^O^ They did? Wow! Good riddens to bad restaurants. Did they finally go out of business?
r: ^o^ Yeah! They'd been bleeding customers for awhile now.

[buttercup_ok]
p1: /._. Oh, I didn't know that. ...Did they just go out of business or what?
r: ^y^ Yeah! They'd been bleeding customers for awhile now.

[buttercup_sad]
p1: u_u They did? Oh no! ...I didn't hear about that. Did something happen? Is Diota okay?
r: /._. Ehh you didn't know? They'd been bleeding customers for awhile now!

r: Pretty sure they burned through their savings and couldn't make rent, it's nothing weird.
r: ^Y^ ...Like I said before, going head to head the garbage food always wins!
r: ._.; I mean the uhh... the GOURMET food! Our food.
 (sensei mood >__<)
s1: ^y^ Well, whatever it is... A win's a win! I say we take it.
 (richie mood ^Y^)
s1: ^__^/ Goodbye everyone! Thank you for treating my beloved restaurant with care.
