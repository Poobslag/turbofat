s1: /._. So, I'm slightly confused by the name Kflab... After all, your names are Kendall and King Frumble Lumps III.
p1: Yeah I was thinking that too. Shouldn't it be...
[kkab] Kkab
[kkflab] Kkflab
[kkfliab] Kkfliab
[kkfliiiab] Kklfliiiab

[kkflab]
p1: /._. Shouldn't it be Kkflab? For 'Kendall' and 'King Frungle Lumps'?
[well]

[kkfliab]
p1: /._. Shouldn't it be Kkfliab? For 'Kendall' and 'King Frungle Lumps Ihh'?
f: @_@ King Frungle Lumps 'IHH'? What the heck is 'Ihh'!?
f: III is a roman numeral, it means 'The Third'! You're saying it like it's a word...
p1: /._. It isn't!? I thought it was just three letter I's! 'Ihh!' I kind of like it that way better.
[anyways]

p1: /._. Shouldn't it be Kkfliiiab? For 'Kendall' and 'King Frungle Lumps III'?
f: ^O^ Yeah! ...That's what I said!

p1: /._. Shouldn't it be Kkab? for 'Kendall' and 'King'?
s1: -_- #player#, 'King' is just an honorific. It's not technically a part of their name.
 (p1 faces right)
f: >_< 'King' is an honorific AND a part of my name!
 (p1 faces left)
s1: Your... Your parents named you 'King'?
f: ^y^ Yes! 'Frungle' is an honorific too. And 'Lumps' is even more honorific! And the 'III' is the cherry on the honor cake!
f: ._./ Come to think of it, you should be WAY more honored to say my name!
s1: <__< Ahh yes. I'm starting to fully appreciate your... onerousness.
 (p1 mood ^o^)

[well]
k: ^_^ Well, King Frungle Lumps III has such an... ample name! We decided to just use the 'Fl' from their name, and the 'K' from my name.

f: >_< The 'K' is from my name too!!!
 (f faces left)
k: <_< Oh sure â€“ well that's true! The 'K' is from both our names. We both share the 'K' part of 'Kflab'.
f: >__< No! The 'K' is from my name, and NOT yours! Your 'K' isn't in the name.
k: u_u It... Ohhhhh...
 (k faces left)
s1: <_< ...
