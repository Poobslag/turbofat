p1: /._. So, you're not quite the hot tourist spot you want to be huh?
k: u_u Well sadly - tourism has been pretty close to zero since we founded this island a few years ago!
k: But the four of us are looking at our options for improving things. We're open to any ideas you have of course!
s1: <__< Well, first of all... "Kflab" is a very... unconventional name. Does it mean anything?
b: ._./ It's the first letter of our names. Kendall, King Frungle Lumps III, Alyssa and Bart. K-F-L-A-B.
k: ._.; You see we all â€“ well, some of us had different ideas for the island's name. So this was the compromise we agreed upon.
s1: ^Y^ Hm. Hm. I see. Well... ...At least your island's stupid name acts as a helpful mnemonic so I can remember your less-stupid names.
p1: Um! Well...
[all_fine] Your names are fine!
[frungle] Frungle, your name is dumb
[kendall] Kendall, your name is pretty
[bart] Bart, your name is normal


[bart]
p1: ._.; Bart, your name is perfectly normal. It's just these other names are a little out there!
 (a mood -_-, f mood -_-, k mood -_-)
p1: Anyway it's nice to meet all of you umm... Shoot let's see, was it...
p1: /._. Kringle...?
 (k mood >__<)
p1: Alopecia...?
 (a mood >__<)
 (s1 faces right)
p1: .__.; ...And... Kung Fu Hustle 3?
 (f mood >__<)
s1: ^N^ That... that wasn't even particularly close.
 (a mood >__<, f mood >__<, k mood >__<)
p1: ...Sorry! I'm probably just groggy from our long flight.

[kendall]
p1: ^__^ Kendall, your name is pretty! It makes me think of Kringles, or gumballs!
k: @_@ ...Gwuh? Gumballs!?
p1: ._.; Umm, sorry! I'm probably just hungry from our long flight.

[frungle]
p1: -_- King Frungle Lumps, your name is the only dumb one! I don't know why Fat Sensei... "lumped" you all together.
 (f mood >_<)
f: >__< THE ONLY DUMB ONE!? Your name's dumber than MY name!
f: What is a "#player#" anyways? Some kind of fig!?
s1: ...Ahh, sorry don't mind us. We're probably just grumpy because of our long flight.
p1: >_< You mean our long run.
s1: <__< Yes... Long flight, long run, whatever...

[all_fine]
p1: ^_^ All your names are just fine! Fat Sensei's not usually THIS bad with first impressions.
p1: ...Maybe they're just grumpy because of our long flight.
