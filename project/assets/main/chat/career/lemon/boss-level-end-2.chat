p1: So what should we call our new restaurant?
s1: Hmm yes. Yes yes well, a name is important. It should reflect our identity and set us apart from our competitors.
p1: I was thinking something like...
[caboodles]
[smack_dab]
[eaties]
[fats_of_life]
[sparky_s]
[junjorito]

[junjorito]
p1: /._. Something like... Junjorito?

[end]

 (stop_walking)
 (set_phrase proposed_restaurant_name Eaties)
s1: ^N^ What on earth is an eatie?

[fats_of_life]

s1: ^N^ Really? You want our restaurant's name to pay homage to a sitcom from what... the 20th century?
p1: ^__^ Yeah! It's sort of plays off of your name you know? Because you're Fat Sensei! The Fats of Life!

[end]

[end]
s1: /._. Hmm hmm, yes. Yes, I see your point, we should give our restaurant a really stupid name.
s1: There aren't a lot of restaurants with stupid names. A name like that could carve out a niche with stupid customers.
 (start_walking)
p1: >_< No, not a STUPID name, just something distinctive...
s1: ^Y^ No, no -- you had it right the first time! Stupid name it is.
s1: I'll let you come up with it, it seems you have a talent for this.
p1: ._.; Th... thank you? I think...
