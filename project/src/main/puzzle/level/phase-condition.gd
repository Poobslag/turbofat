class_name PhaseCondition
## Defines the conditions under which a level trigger should fire.
##
## A level can contain triggers which make something happen at a specific time, such as 'add a row of blocks if the
## player clears one of the bottom three lines'. A PhaseCondition encapsulates the concept of 'the player clears one of
## the bottom three lines', defining what 'the bottom three lines' means and that the check should happen during a line
## clear.

## Creates a new PhaseCondition instance.
##
## The default implementation ignores the '_definition_params' array, but this can be overridden to parse or store the
## parameters.
##
## Parameters:
## 	'_phase_config': (Optional) Set of phase configuration strings defining criteria for a phase condition.
func _init(_phase_config: Dictionary) -> void:
	pass


## Extracts a set of phase configuration strings from this phase condition.
##
## This performs the inverse of the configuration part of the _init() function, extracting values from the phase
## condition's properties and using them to populate a dictionary.
##
## Returns:
## 	A set of phase configuration strings defining criteria for this phase condition.
func get_phase_config() -> Dictionary:
	return {}


## Can be overridden to return 'true' if a trigger should run during this phase.
##
## The default implementation always returns true, but subclasses can override this behavior.
##
## Parameters:
## 	'_event_params': (Optional) Phase-specific metadata used to decide whether the trigger should fire
func should_run(_event_params: Dictionary) -> bool:
	return true
