class_name NightModeToggler
extends Node
## Changes the color/visibility of nodes at night.
##
## During night mode, some nodes darken to different shades of blue, some nighttime nodes are made visible, and other
## daytime nodes are made invisible. To change the color/visibility of a node at night, it must be assigned to one of
## the following groups:
##
## 	'night_mode_dark': The node and its children will become dark blue at night, and uncolored during the day
## 	'night_mode_dark_self': The node will become dark blue at night, and uncolored during the day
## 	'night_mode_invisible': The node will become invisible at night, and visible during the day
## 	'night_mode_light': The node and its children will become light blue at night, and uncolored during the day
## 	'night_mode_light_self': The node will become light blue at night, and uncolored during the day
## 	'night_mode_visible': The node will become visible at night, and invisible during the day

## Dark blue color assigned to nodes in the 'night_mode_dark' group
const DARK_BLUE := Color("6b6bdc")

## Light blue color assigned to nodes in the 'night_mode_light' group
const LIGHT_BLUE := Color("aed8d0")

## Amount of time it takes to transition from day to night, or from night to day.
const TWEEN_DURATION := 0.3

var _night_mode := false

## Set of Node instances which are being gradually modulated to transparent.
var _nodes_modulated_to_transparent := {}

## Adjusts node colors and visibility during day/night transitions.
@onready var _tween: Tween

func _exit_tree() -> void:

## Transition the puzzle to day/night mode, with an accompanying visual effect.
##
## Parameters:
## 	'new_night_mode': 'true' to transition to night mode, 'false' to transition to day mode.
##
## 	'duration': (Optional) Transition duration in seconds. A value of 0.0 will transition instantly. If omitted, a
## 		default transition duration will be used.

## Tweens the modulate properties of all daytime/nighttime nodes in the scene tree.
##
## This finds all nodes in the 'night_mode_...' groups and adjusts their modulate property appropriately. This usually
## involves launching a tween, although a duration of '0.0' will result in an instantaneous change without a tween.
##
## Parameters:
## 	'duration': (Optional) Transition duration in seconds. A value of 0.0 will transition instantly. If omitted, a
## 		default transition duration will be used.

## Interpolates a node's property, or sets it instantly if duration is zero.
