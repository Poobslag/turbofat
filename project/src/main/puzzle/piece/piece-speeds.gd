## Stores data about the different 'piece speeds' such as how fast pieces should drop, how long it takes them to lock
## into the playfield, and how long to pause when clearing lines.
##
## Much of this speed data was derived from wikis for other piece-dropping games which have the concept of a 'hold
## piece' so it's likely it will change over time to become more lenient.

## All gravity constants are integers like '16', which actually correspond to fractions like '16/256' which means the
## piece takes 16 frames to drop one row. G is the denominator of that fraction.
const G := 256

## The maximum number of 'lock resets' the player is allotted for a single piece. A lock reset occurs when a piece is
## at the bottom of the screen but the player moves or rotates it to prevent from locking.
const MAX_LOCK_RESETS := 15

## The gravity constant used when the player soft-drops a piece.
const DROP_G := 128

## After the player does a 'squish move' the piece is unaffected by gravity for this many frames.
const POST_SQUISH_FRAMES := 4

## How fast the pieces are moving right now
var current_speed: PieceSpeed

## Array of speed ids in ascending order
var speed_ids := []

## Matrix of piece speed adjustments.
##
## Each row in the matrix represents a set of speeds in order from slowest to fastest. Speeds which give the player a
## speed advantage are given their own group (e.g playing with a 200 ms appearance delay instead of a 300 ms
## appearance delay.)
