## data is written eventually to the save file.
##
## This also includes transient data such as the current creature/bonus score. This is used visually, but never saved.

## emitted when the game will start soon. Everything should be erased and reset to zero.
signal game_prepared

## emitted after everything's been erased in preparation for a new game.
signal after_game_prepared

## emitter after the initial countdown finishes, when the player can start playing.
signal game_started

## emitted during tutorials, when changing from one tutorial section to the next
signal before_level_changed(new_level_id)

signal after_level_changed

## emitted when the player survives until the end the level.
signal finish_triggered

## emitted when the player reaches the end of a tutorial section
signal tutorial_section_finished

signal game_ended

## emitted several seconds after the game ends
signal after_game_ended

## emitted on the frame that the player drops and locks a new piece
signal before_piece_written

## emitted after the piece is written, and all boxes are made, and all lines are cleared
signal after_piece_written

signal score_changed

## emitted when a combo value changes, when building or ending a combo
signal combo_changed(value)

## emitted when a combo ends -- this will usually coincide with the combo resetting to zero, but at the end of a level
