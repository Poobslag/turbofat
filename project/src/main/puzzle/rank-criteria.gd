class_name RankCriteria
## Calculates grades based on time or score thresholds.
##
## Each level defines the rank criteria for the best rank, and can optionally define rank criteria for other ranks.
## The remaining ranks are calculated by interpolation.

## Each level defines the rank criteria for the best rank, but if no rank criteria is specified these values are used
## instead. These values are arbitrary and will not produce meaningful output, so we log a warning if they are used.

## Adds a new time or score threshold.
##
## Parameters:
## 	'grade': grade
##
## 	'threshold': Time/score threshold for the grade
func add_threshold(grade: String, threshold: int) -> void:

## Calculates the corresponding rank for the specified time or score.
##
## Note: Ranks are only calculated based on the currently stored grade threshold boundaries. fill_missing_thresholds()
## should be called first to ensure there is a full set of boundaries with sensible values. Otherwise, if the player
## finishes a level in 30 minutes instead of a goal time of 3 minutes, the algorithm will calculate "Well, 30 minutes
## is half-way between 3 minutes and an hour, so that's an S+ rank"
##
## Parameters:
## 	'value': The time or score value.
##
## Returns:
## 	A rank value in the range (0.0, 999.0). Lower numbers represent a better rank.

## and "A-" boundaries, while the remaining boundaries are populated with this algorithm.
