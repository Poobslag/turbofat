 * A shader which takes an RGB image, and replaces the red component with one color, the green component with a second
 * color, and the blue component with a third color. Black pixels are also replaced with a fourth color. A pixel
 * which is mostly red but a little green will be replaced with the first and second colors.
 *
 * This approach allow a sprite to be recolored with up to four channels, and the recoloring can be handled by the
 * graphics card. It's performant and looks reasonable even if the sprite is resized before being passed off to the
 * graphics card.
