#tool #uncomment to view creature in editor
class_name CreatureVisuals
extends Node2D
## Handles animations and audio/visual effects for a creature.
##
## To edit creatures in the Godot editor:
## 	1. Run the 'edit-creature.sh on' shell command to enable the necessary tool scripts
## 	2. Toggle the CreatureVisuals.random_creature property in the Godot editor
## 	3. Make your changes
## 	4. When you're finished, toggle the CreatureVisuals.reset_creature property in the Godot editor
## 	5. Lastly, run the 'edit-creature.sh off' shell command to disable the necessary tool scripts
##
## Do not leave the tool scripts enabled. Doing so causes errors in the Godot console and impacts performance as
## unnecessary textures are loaded.
