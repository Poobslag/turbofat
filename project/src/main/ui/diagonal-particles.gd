## Emits a burst of particles in four diagonal directions.
##
## Using a single Particles2D with a 360Â° spread is problematic, because it often emits a burst of particles in the
## same direction instead of a spread in all directions. This script aims a set of Particles2D nodes in different
## directions to get a more uniform spread.
