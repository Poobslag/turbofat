## Updates the distance label after the player selects a level.

## After the player selects a label, the distance penalty is applied to the player's distance travelled. This method
## updates the label's text with the player's raw distance travelled with no penalty applied. This prevents a bug
## where we temporarily display the distance with the penalty applied twice.
