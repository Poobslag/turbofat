class_name UniqueLevelAchievement
extends SteamAchievement
## Unlocks an achievement when a condition is met during a specific level.
##
## This script is specifically extended by achievements which cannot rely on save data, and which must check for a
## condition while the level is still being played.
##
## For achievements such as "reach this score" or "reach this rank", we can check the player's save data because we
## always save their best score or best rank. However for arbitrary achievements like "Have six carrots visible on a
## level" or "Earn Â¥500 from your first customer" we can't check the save data, either because the data isn't saved or
## because it can be erased by a higher score which doesn't reach that arbitrary milestone.

## The level ID whose achievement condition should be checked.
