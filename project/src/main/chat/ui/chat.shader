 * Recolors the chat window to use vibrant colors and a scrolling background.
 *
 * The chat window has a colored texture or 'accent' which scrolls in a vaguely circular motion across a white
 * background. The texture can be resized or recolored. It can also be swapped so that it draws white shapes against
 * a colored background.
 *
 * The shader is applied to a texture which contains a black outlined shape with red inside, and transparent outside.
 * The shader code uses the red channel of the texture to determine where to draw the background accents.
